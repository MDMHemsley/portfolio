1,Fantasy,The lightning-struck heart by TJ Klune... literally a wattpad story?,[removed]
2,Fantasy,Best Fantasy (but also sci fi!) novel titles ?,"As the title says.

What were the best novel titles you have ever encountered in your reading (but also writing) life?"
3,Fantasy,Which grim darkish fantasy book(s) are so deep that if adapted to the screen Oscar nominated or Oscar winning directors would be interested in tackling it?,"Which books do you guys think would attract the attention of Oscar nominated or wining directors? 

I’d love to see Alejandro Iñarritu tackle a book or series from just the brutal and realistic way they filmed The Revenant. I could feel cold even in the summer watching that movie because it’s so immersive 

Another director I’d love to see would be Denis Villeneuve adapt a series. Every single movies in my opinion is a hit. He hasn’t slowed up a bit since his very first bigger film with Prisoners. He has a way of disguising a movie into a summer Hollywood blockbuster but they are way deeper than that, filmed with this slow burn and often win Oscar’s .. he has Dune releasing this year so that’s exciting

Scott Cooper is another that comes to mind. I really feel like he could bring out the brutal atmosphere of a grim dark or grim darkish story with his slower paced but sudden acts of violence in his films 

And after the release of Joker I have my eye on Todd Phillips .. 

What are your thoughts?"
4,Fantasy,My Bingo Obsession Made Manifest - Retro Bingo,"My first experience with the book bingo reading challenge was for the 2018 card. I completed one full card and about half of a second. I loved it, even the bad books I read for it. For the 2019 card I set out to do more. I wanted to complete a full hard mode card and a full second card as well. It was roughly a year ago today when I was working on my fourth bingo card for the 2019 reading challenge that I had a different idea. I thought, instead of filling out an entire fourth card maybe there was a different reading challenge I could undertake that would satisfy my newfound love for bingo. At that point, I started looking at the years of bingo that I had missed and decided I could try to do the three years of bingo prior to when I joined in. I decided to call it retro bingo for myself and went wild making spreadsheets and looking at the old threads.

I wanted to read some books that were popular for that year’s challenge, and in particular each specific square. This didn’t work out as often as I would have liked because sometimes I had already read the book or had little interest in it. If there is one thing I learned from all this bingo it was to get a much better sense of how to tell which books I will like or not before heading into them. Another rule that I made for myself was to make sure the books had been published in time to be eligible for each challenge. I thought that reading newer books for this would be fun too but eventually decided to go the other way. Maybe that could be for another challenge later on, using say, the 2017 card but only read books published after 2017.

5,Fantasy,"If your fictional universe you're writing has dragons and magic in it, there's no real reason it can't also have black people or Asian people in it.","I think the idea of fantasy worlds are so cool. I love seeing dragons and magic and struggles between good and evil. It's all amazing to me. But when some people get their panties in a twist about forced diversity because one background character is darker than others it just makes me think that you're too indoctrinated by this political climate we live in to enjoy the actual story. There's a fucking dragon getting slayed but you are pissed there's an Asian wizard in the background in the climatic fight scene? That doesn't sound like an actual grevience. Sounds like a personal problem.

I'll take it a step further. I don't care if main characters are diverse. If it's a fictional world not based on any real people I say go nuts. People say it's pandering but litterally it's all pandering. White dudes get pandered too so much they don't even notice it like a fish in water. Let me have a bad ass Asian dude on a quest to unite the four kingdoms with a bad ass party full of knights and wizards. I don't care as long as the story is good but someone being a different skin color in a fantasy setting that's not based on actual things that happened doesn't and shouldn't bother anyone."

10,Fantasy,Book Review: The Terror by Dan Simmons,"In the summer of 1845, the Royal Navy dispatched two ships, HMS *Erebus* and HMS *Terror*, under the command of Sir John Franklin to the Arctic Ocean. Their orders were to enter the Canadian Arctic Archipelago by means of Lancaster Sound (west of Greenland) and seek out the North-West Passage, which would lead them to the Pacific via the Bering Strait and thus home by way of Russia, China and India. Whilst both the eastern and western edges of the Passage had been explored by this time, no ship had successfully travelled the entire length of the Passage.

Neither ship was heard from again\*.

Over the following years, concern over the expedition's fate grew and many search and rescue expeditions were launched, some by ship and others by foot, travelling up the rivers from the Canadian interior. A number of relics and remains were found, confusingly scattered across a large area of more than a hundred miles surrounding King William Island, and over time other expeditions have pieced together the facts, upon which the narrative of *The Terror* is based.

*The Terror*, like Stephen Donaldson's **Gap** series and George R.R. Martin's **Song of Ice and Fire**, uses a rotating third-person limited point of view system, moving between several characters. The narrative opens in late 1847 with the two ships forced to spend a second winter in a row stuck fast in the ice. Extensive flashbacks and diaries record the earlier stage of the expedition, with optimism over finding the North-West Passage turning to despair as the ships make little progress against the ice. After being snowed in at King William Island, an unidentified predator starts stalking the crews, accounting for many lives including that of Sir John Franklin, leaving Captain Crozier of the *Terror* in command of the expedition. Discovering that the ships' stores are contaminated by an unknown source (later - in real life - revealed to be lead poisoning from either the inadequately-sealed tinned foods or the water tanks) and they cannot survive another winter, in April 1848 Crozier makes the decision to strike out for the Canadian mainland by foot and attempt to follow the Back River to civilisation.

*The Terror* is a meticulously researched novel. Simmons has clearly done his homework here, further evidenced by the considerable bibliography. The details of shipboard life are fascinating, and Simmons is painstaking in ensuring that the reader understands at all times the options and problems facing the expedition's leaders, most notably the paralysis that grips them when presented with the option of abandoning ship and continuing overland and over the ice on foot, or hoping that a summer thaw will free their ships. The characters - virtually all of whom are given the names of the real Franklin Expedition crewmen - are vividly drawn, from the flawed but nonetheless charismatic and professional Crozier to the bumbling Franklin to the naive but eventually heroic surgeon Goodsir to the perpetually cheerful Blanky, and the use of them to tell the story is very well done, although there is a pause when Simmons has some of the crew doing some very unpalatable things with no evidence those individuals ever did those things in reality. However, that is often the case with fictionalizing real events. Simmons also nails the biting, freezing atmosphere of the Arctic and imbues the story with some very atmospheric descriptions of the frozen ice landscapes.

A problem with the book is also its hallmark (and what moves it from being a historical novel to a fantastical one), the presence of the 'thing on the ice' (a nod to the 1951 movie *The Thing From Another World*), a terrifying creature which shows up at almost regular intervals to kill a few people, sometimes mutilating them (apparently for pleasure), before vanishing. The first time this happens it is effectively shocking. Around the fifth or sixth it starts to get a bit repetitive. The monster is also highly reminiscent of the Shrike, Simmons' superb creation from his **Hyperion Cantos** series of SF novels, and although the monster in *The Terror* isn't quite as godlike (nor does it have a giant metal tree to impale people on), its abilities will feel very familiar to anyone who has read the earlier work. 

Eventually an interesting explanation is given for the creature, cleverly based on Inuit mythology, but it literally comes in the final two chapters of a 950-page novel, long after the creature's appearances have stopped raising any genuine feelings of tension or fear. Also, the non-monster sections are as well-written and gripping as the bits where it does appear, making the storyline feel a bit redundant. When the genuine horrors of surviving in the Arctic with poisoned supplies and dwindling hopes are this compelling, why throw in a ravening monster as well? Whilst thematically interesting, the presence of the monster feels like it cheapens some of the genuine accomplishments of the real Franklin Expedition.

*The Terror* (\*\*\*\*) is often brilliant, but it is overlong and the monster is overused, robbing it of its power. Ignoring that, this is a gripping and fascinating novel of man's desire to survive no matter the odds.

In 2018 AMC also produced a highly-accomplished 10-episode adaptation of the novel, which arrived this week in the UK via BBC2 and the BBC iPlayer service.

\*Until 2014 and 2016, when the wrecks of both ships were successfully located off King William Island."

15,Fantasy,Justice in certain situations. [spoilers for mistborn and city of lies by Sam Hawke],"When we consider a situation like in Mistborn or City of Lies, the common people have been abused for years by the rich and nobles and they finally decide to rebel. Now this is so much pent up tension getting out of hand and people want justice. But there's kind of a problem with 'justice' here. In such cases if the common people win it will almost certainly end in the nobles execution. Even if they committed some crimes, they don't deserve death IMO, unless the crimes are particularly extreme. If the nobles find some way to pacify them, and everything is resolved peacefully, the nobles still remain in power and there is no way they would be punished. 

In such a situation, if the story is from the nobles' perspective who want to reform themselves like City of Lies, how can this problem be solved?

Conversely if the story is from the commoner's POV, like in Mistborn, how could the people justify the crew putting Elend as head and no nobles being punished? I mean sure there will be people who are just glad it's over. But I should think the majority of people after finally having been given hope would have rebelled against Elend no matter how good he is for the simple fact that none of the nobles were punished. This was one of the reasons why I couldn't support Wax in trying to keep the current government in power. They hadn't learned anything, conditions weren't as bad as before sure, but the poor are still being exploited. I still enjoyed the story though. Just couldn't care about the motivations of the heroes nor the villains.

So my question is, what is an effective way to mete out justice in such situations?"
16,Fantasy,Recommendation Request: Cyberpunk with Magic?,"I love playing in the Shadowrun setting, and I love books like [The Last Hot Time](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/268439) (although that's a bit more UF). 

So looking for:

* Near-future (or interpretations of the near-future)
* Probably a bit dystopian
* Futuristic, but possibly ramshackle, tech
* Magic! Possibly fantasy races, possibly spell-slingers, whatever.
* Themes around rebellion and resistance

I *really* like urban fantasy and paranormal romance, but I do think there's a genre dividing line between, say, Ilona Andrews, and cyberpunk fantasy.

I also really, *really* like short stories. So if there are short fiction or anthology examples, that's handy too.

Thanks!"

Hi All!

I’m Gabriela Houston, the author of an upcoming Slavic-mythology-inspired fantasy novel, *The Second Bell* published by Angry Robot Books, and a co-host of Bookish Take, a YouTube writing channel.

Today, on the 4th of March, starting at 9AM GMT I will be taking part in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) here on Reddit.  


The Second Bell explores the themes of motherhood, social exclusion and social taboos in two communities ruled by fear and superstition.

In an isolated mountain town, sometimes a child is born with two hearts. Such a child - a striga - is considered a dangerous demon, which must be abandoned on the edge of the forest to protect the community. The only choice the child's mother can make is whether to leave her home with her infant, or stay behind and try to forget. Miriat made her choice. She and her nineteen-year-old striga daughter, Salka, now live a life of deprivation and hardship in a remote striga village, where to follow the impulses of the other heart is forbidden. But Salka is headstrong and young, and when threatened with losing everything, she is forced to explore the depths of her true nature, testing the bonds between mother and child. 

So if you want to know more about the book, Slavic folklore, my writing process, the glory of my cat, or anything else really that I can possibly answer,leave me a question! 

And if you want to join me at the live launch event cohosted by Angry Robot Books and the Super Relaxed Fantasy Club, you can watch it for free on youtube or SRFC Facebook page on the 9th of March, starting at 2PM (EST)/7PM (GMT):

23,Fantasy,[Bingo Reviews]: The Memory Police by Yōko Ogawa; Rhythm of War by Brandon Sanderson; The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson.,"What is likely to be my second-to-last of Bingo reviews. I'll be more reflective at its conclusion, but suffice to say (1) this was extremely enjoyable, and; (2) I will not hit my goal of reading one book for every square. Life was busy this year and, in combination with alternating between fiction and non-fiction books, I'll just barely hit true Bingo this year. Onwards!

-------------

*The Memory Police* by Yōko Ogawa.

I don't know what it's like in other countries, but in the US, there is a steady diet of future dystopian novels that one reads in high school, designed to remind us all of how close modern society flirted with authoritarianism. It may have been a consequence of my generation being so far removed from that flirtation that I found most of these novels a little too on the nose, and consequently difficult to appreciate. I felt as though the authors left little to the imagination when it came to their respective allegories, and while some part of that was, I'm sure, being a teenager and wanting to seem above my assignments, but it's nevertheless a feeling I didn't wholly outgrow.

If I had my druthers, *this* would be the book to assign school kids who needed to learn about the dangers of thought policing, double-speak, and the cumulative oppression of governments first telling you not to worry, then telling you not to ask questions.

The conceit of The Memory Police is simple: for reasons unknown to us, memories disappear. We're not sure if this is a state act or some odd phenomenon to which the state is reacting -- or perhaps simply using. You wake up one morning, and something is amiss. Then you realize there are no more ribbons, or birds, or whatever. You can no longer conjure up that image in your mind, or recall what it did, or how it tasted or felt.

Some people keep their memories; they are caught and culled. We don't know what happens to them, but they're disappeared. The book starts out with these people being the traditional ""other"" who, by no fault of their own, doesn't comply with the government's vision of citizen. The protagonist, an author, finds herself in the position of being able to help someone who keeps their memories. Her story, as I read it, was an analogy to those in World War II who focused their resistance on providing shelter and safety to vulnerable populations. Each comfort she is able to provide is an act of defiance. Because so many memories have disappeared, most of this comes in the form of provisioning food and drink, which I thought captured the state of affairs well without needing to hit the reader over the head with how impoverished society had become, both literally (a small baked sweet is a treat) and figuratively (as we lose our memories, we lose our sense of self, history, culture, space, and reality.)

The book ends as the main character grapples with the question of what happens when we forget ourselves. I won't spoil, but this isn't really a book to spoil. You can probably guess the answer to that question, and could likely predict it in the first few pages. It's logical to wonder how far memory loss can take a society if everything lost ultimately disappears.

**Enjoyment:** 5 - it is not a happy book, but I measure enjoyment, in part, with how aware I am that I'm reading, and I got thoroughly lost in this book)

**Execution:** 4 - given the Bingo square this occupies, and having read some poor translations, I would have had no idea this wasn't originally in English if you hadn't told me.

**Recommended to:** Everyone, honestly. I think now is a good time to read books that remind us of the value of free society. It is maybe an old-fashioned or American-centric approach to this sort of book, but it's still something I think is valuable.

**Not Recommended to:** Anyone looking for a feel-good book.

**[Bingo squares](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D8FwFu701bmPfvN707viYiKVgCAGpTqCYwPiJeumGCs/edit?usp=sharing):** Translated from its original language

-------------------

*Rhythm of War* by Brandon Sanderson.

This might be shorter, because Sanderson's books get a lot of runway in fantasy these days, so I feel it needs little introduction. I will start by saying I love Sanderson's books. I think the Knights Radiant series, of which this book is a part, could be described as an action/adventure subgenre of fantasy. While I too like Wheel of Time, The Hobbit, and other more traditional fantasy, sometimes you want to read about a rag tag team with special powers coming together and fighting evil, but with explosions and humor and an ever-growing cosmere with its own physics.

First, the good: Sanderson is nothing if not consistent. I never feel like the next book in a series is any less than the one previous. It's obvious in his writing that the man outlines. It's neat and organized. Despite a huge cast of characters that now span across the entire map at the front of the book, you can *generally* hop right back into the overarching story, and *generally* keep good tabs on each character's unique arc. Reading Rhythm of War was like getting the band back together despite their disparate locations because I am so interested in these people and their inner lives.

The bad: I have read this series as each book has come out, and it needs a dramatis personae. I remembered the royal family and Kaladin. Everyone else was a vague recollection I had to piece together, sometimes going back to wikis while also avoiding spoilers. I needed to remember a few plot reveals in the early books that were a Big Deal at the time but were no longer in my brain. Maybe it's me, maybe it's the book. I'm not actually sure what a good solution is for sweeping epics that come out year-over-year, but I'll say that I personally need someone to hold my hand so I can jog my memory, and that was a constant blocker to total immersion. I suspect my rating would be - and will be - higher after a straight reread of all the books.

**Enjoyment:** 5 - it's like the time I learned how to snowboard. I was on my butt a lot but had tons of fun the whole time, and towards the end I felt like I knew what I was doing.

**Execution:** 3.5 - for the aforementioned flaws above.

**Recommended to:** People who read the first books. For those who haven't started the series, you'll probably enjoy it if you enjoyed *Mistborn,* but read *Mistborn* first.

**Not Recommended to:** People who haven't started the series, anyone who uses ""LitRPG"" pejoratively.

*The Traitor Baru Cormorant* by Seth Dickinson

I was looking forward to the ""Features Politics"" square because I am an awful person who enjoys reading about politics. Not current events, though I do do that just because it seems responsible, but I like history, political theory, law, and related junk. I picked up this book because it was on my list of possibilities and recognized that I had just purchased it as a lightning deal for my Kindle. Fortuitous!

This book is not for everyone, but it was certainly for me. Some people - normal people - like murder mysteries and who-dunnits. Me? I am a lawyer, so I know a good audit when I see one, and having a book revolve around checking the books was *mmmmmm.* Monetary theory go brrrrr.

It sounds like I'm joking, but I'm not. Dickinson creates this detailed world where a major colonial power practiced in quasi-religious eugenics seeks to colonize through the power of market dominance and, failing that, an iron fist. All the characters are refreshingly savvy, and it's more a question of whose successfully leverages their natural strengths at the right time. There's a randomness or luck component that constantly hovers in the air. You can be as competent as you want, but you can't account (ha!) for everything. The main character, Baru Cormorant, is something of a math savant who uses her role as a glorified auditor to become the iconic leader of rebellion against said major power.

I thought I knew where this book was going to take me, and that I'd simply get there differently. Instead of swords and boards or spells, it would be a checkbook. I'd read a bit more about how playing with the food supply in this village might cause them to lose faith in the protagonist's enemies, or how injecting bank notes into the city would have such a massive inflationary effect that it would utterly gut an entire movement for the foreseeable future. Then we would get to a neat ending where the ... not hero, but she's you work with what you have ... anyway, where our not-hero figures out her place in the world, achieves a bunch of stuff, and we move on to book 2.

Then the book ended and I was like ""WHAT"" and I bought book 2.

**Enjoyment:** 4.3

**Execution:** 4.25

**Recommended to:** People amused by the [Hayek v. Keynes rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nERTFo-Sk).

26,Fantasy,Magic systems without genetic predispositions to magic,"I’m looking for the rare examples in fantasy magic systems where there is no genetic predisposition to being able to use magic.  Basically, a system where nobody is a wizard just because you were born with a seemingly genetic ability to use magic. I’m not saying I want a system where everyone’s a mage or everyone can be a mage, just that magic can potentially be learned by anyone with a certain aptitude like any job in real life.  Nobody is “born” to be a rocket scientist or astronaut for example, but anyone can potentially be one if they have the right skills.

The best example are wizards from D&amp;D, who learn magic from studying it and anyone smart enough and dedicated enough who can get the proper training can be a wizard.

The Rivers of London series also has a similar system, as magic is basically just an extension of science in that world.  Anyone can learn it, but it’s very hard and there aren’t many teachers who can teach it left in the world."

31,Fantasy,One Mike to Read them All: The Neverending Story by Michael Ende,"This will be a review in two parts. Spoilers for the movie. If you haven’t seen the movie, what the hell is wrong with you? Go watch it, it’s on Netflix.

So the first half of this book is, basically, the movie. I’ve seen the movie who-knows-how-many times over the course of my life, so I can’t really be said to be unbiased, but this is a case of the movie adaptation *surpassing* the original book. It’s a very rare thing. Not that there is anything lacking about the book - it inspires many of the same feelings as the movie, I just think the story works a little better as a movie than a book. But again, biased and all. It also helps that movie-Bastian is just plain more likeable than book-Bastian.

(Also, given that it’s been over 30 years since I first saw the movie, you’d think I would have been braced for poor Artax in the Swamp of Sorrows. I wasn’t. It was actually even *worse* when read.)

But as wonderful a story as *The Neverending Story* is (when we’re talking about the movie/first-half-of-the-book) it’s also a bit shallow. It celebrates the wonderful love of reading that so many of us here at /r/Fantasy share, but it isn’t a story that really challenges you. It’s one that sweeps you up and whisks you off to Fantastica, as it were.

But when we move beyond the movie/first-half-of-the-book, things get much more interesting.

So, as everyone who has seen the movie knows (are you still here if you haven’t? Seriously, go watch it and thank me later) the movie ends with the Empress telling Bastian to wish for anything he wants, and the more he wishes, the more wonderful the recreated Fantastica will become. So we get a montage featuring Atreyu riding on Artax, and the Rock-biter, and everything else destroyed by the Nothing back the way it was and better than ever.

The book takes a different tack.

Bastian is in Fantastica, and again the Empress tells him to wish for whatever he wants. And since the wishes come from his innermost self, Bastian finds himself tall and strong and charming and, to be honest, an asshole. Bastian spends pretty much all of his wishes on himself, which is (if we’re being honest) what most of us would default to.

So how can Bastian make Fantastica a better place by being a selfish asshole? The short answer is that he can’t. It’s not a new idea - “be careful what you wish for” is older than dirt - but Michael Ende does a great job exploring it. This book is a coming-of-age story in a way the movie is not. It’s only when Bastian realizes that the things that he *thinks* he wants aren’t the things he *actually* wants that he can put things right at all.

Overall reading this was a somewhat odd experience. The first half was more-or-less just reading the book-of-the-movie, and a much-loved movie at that. Nothing surprised me, I enjoyed it, and I was vaguely wondering (given the pace and how much  of the story was left, based on my knowledge of the movie) who the heck there was so much book left. I did not expect to find that the end was only the middle, and that Bastian’s real journey was only beginning.

Not entirely sure how this book ended up something I had never gotten to before now, but I’m glad to finally say that I have read it. It was a rewarding read, and well worth the wait.

36,Fantasy,How strong are the characters in Malazan?,"Hey guys I’m new to Malazan and I plan to start GOTM this week and I just was curious on how strong the character’s personalities are? For example I’ve always felt like A Game of Thrones and The First Law trilogy all had characters with unique and specific personalities. So much so that I felt like I was watching them instead of reading them. Villains or heroes they all seemed so fleshed out and interesting. Just wondering if that’s what I’m going to get with this series, not just that but it made me feel that much more engaged with them knowing that with any chapter they could die or become disfigured/handicapped"
37,Fantasy,My rambling review of Oh Sh*t I F*cking Hate Spiders: Arachnomancer Book 1,"All right so I'm going to preface this post with a few disclaimers.
1) I've got carpal tunnel in both hands and I'm dictating this through my phone keyboard so sorry about any grammar, formatting, or random inserted words.
2) I'm only going to review books that I enjoyed and think deserve some love. If I finish a book it gets five stars. The purpose of this post is more to just inform people about books that I enjoy and maybe help a few new indie authors out
3) I pretty much only read litrpg. For people not familiar with the genre it's entirely indie authors and small publishers so the standards are not nearly as high as they would be for traditionally published fantasy books.
4) I am very against cilantro in all forms. That's it.


Okay now that that's over with, here's my post.


I just finished oh sh*t I f*cking hate spiders: arachnomancer book one and I decided to try posting reviews of books when I finish them so that I can hopefully help spread the word.

The story is about a guy named Dhane who gets isekai'd by a truck and wakes up in heaven. There he's given the choice of divinity, but as he goes to choose one, the spider goddess crawls across his hands and becomes his divinity. This makes him the first human with a shadow divinity and puts him at odds with the rest of the world.

I don't want to spoil any of the plot, that's just my base summary of the beginning of the book.

So I'm going to start off by listing the things I enjoyed about the book: 
First off, I enjoyed the sense of humor. A lot of the times authors have a hard time walking the line between a funny story and a serious one, but I thought the author did a pretty good job with that. There were a few parts that just barely touched on breaking the fourth wall that I appreciated. And the idea of a main character who is terrified of spiders but has a spider summon and spider powers was hilarious. It would have been very easy to overplay it or mess it up and I'm glad the author didn't do that.
Another thing I enjoyed about this book was the story. When I bought it I was a bit worried that the entire book would be about him hating spiders and it would be mostly a gimmick. Instead it the world felt pretty fleshed out and I had no issues with the overlying plot.
Finally, I thought the book ended at a good point and it looks like it's going to have some cool city building mechanics in book two

Now for the things I think the author could have improved on
There were a few spelling and grammar issues in the book no more than most indie books, but it definitely could have used a proofreader.
Some of the characters actions felt strange to me. They seemed to be Incredibly invested in the light versus Shadow war and felt like caricatures at times

Overall I thought the book was a lot of fun if you're not looking for something too serious and as someone who hates spiders I can very much relate to Dhane.

Thanks for reading the post, and if people enjoy my ramblings I'll try to post a review whenever I finish a book (not that often lol)"

43,Fantasy,Let's talk about Fairy Tales and Fairy-Tale Inspired Fantasy,"Fairy Tales are one of the classic forms of a fantasy story, and I'd recently been thinking about retellings and fairy-tale esque stories, of which I'm separating into 2 types from what I can see, there are the familiar fairy tale *stories* and then there's the fairy tale *style* of which fairy tale inspired stories seem to have elements of at least one of these categories. 

# Fairy Tale Plot/Characters

This is when the novel is directly basing itself off a particular (or more!)  tale and usually what people first think of when talking about fairy-tale style books. Sometimes they just include the characters in a new situation, sometimes they tell the story from the perspective of a new character, or add a new dimension to the story, sometimes it's just being in the world. You could almost call it fairy tale fanfic.

This plays really well with (credit to Sanderson's writing excuses podcast) the idea of using the familiar and the strange to draw readers in. You have a familiar plot or characters with some new factor mixed in. 

**Example Stories and different ways to take retellings**

* **Cinder** by Marissa Meyer takes the expected fairy tale stories (cinderella, little red riding hood, snow white) and places them in a sci fi setting. While the reader expects many of the plot points there is a great enjoyment in seeing how it is changed by and fits in perfectly to this sci-fi world. It doesn't ""feel"" like a fairy-tale but it is a retelling because we know the stories they're based on
* **Burning Roses** takes the approach of examining fairy tale characters after their fairy tales and builds a world that allows for that character examination while adding details that expand on and change the original tales. We have a middle aged Little Red Riding Hood and Hou Yi as well as diving into some of said Little Red Riding Hood's childhood relationship with Goldilox. 
*  **Ember** by Bettie Sharpe subverts Cinderella by giving a more malicious cinderella, the tale is very recognizable but wonderfully changed
* **Heartless** by Marissa Meyer gives us a backstory, what happened to make our fairy tale Queen of Hearts Villain (and how did Alice in Wonderland join what I consider to be fairy tales? I'm not sure). These are fun, because fairy tales tend to have more straightforward villains, so getting a more complex dive on them is appealing
* **Goose Girl** by Shannon Hale feels like more straightforward retelling though with the world and characters much more deeply fleshed out. Knowing the tale in advanced added a lot of anxiety to the reading as I knew what was coming and grew to care about the characters. Other events that happened differently (or maybe that I'd just forgotten about?) hit me so much harder for not expecting it

# Fairy Tale Style

This one is obviously less straightforward and one of the things that made me want to write out my thoughts. What makes something *feel* like a fairy tale. What makes me enjoy that fairy tale feeling?

Frequently fairy tale style prose has all the hallmarks of ""bad writing""^(™)  It's often very ""telly,"" frequently head hops, and yet it works. At first I assumed this was more of a we forgive it the style is old (a la reading original fairy tales) but I recently read some stories that make use of creating new fairy tales and I loved them

**Examples**

* **Tales from the Hinterland** are a collection of new fairy tales all written in the fairy tale style. (It's also an the in-universe book for the Hazel Wood series). They're fun and reminiscent of the darker fairy tales, things just happen and are accepted, there's the aforementioned telling, and head hopping, and everything just well works for me.
* **How the King of Elfhame Learned to Hate Stories** this is a companion novella in the Cruel Prince universe and makes great use of an in universe fairy tale that is told multiple times and adapted throughout the story. The story works even while being told multiple times, something about the cadence, knowing there will be a change, etc all while using the familiar fairy-tale style prose
* **Love Laws and a Locked Heart** from Fantasy Magazine [issue 61](https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/new/admin/new-issues/nov-2020-issue-61/) also tells a new fairy tale reminiscent of other fairy tales. It feels like a fairy tale and I can't really tell you why and that bothers me, and I similarly liked it. 

Anyway,  thank you if you read my ramblings.  I would love to hear your thoughts as well. Do you like fairy tale inspired stories? Why/Why not? Other thoughts on fairy tales/fairy tale inspired stories?"
44,Fantasy,"Looking for a reccomendation: something funny (or at least witty), and with only one POV.","I've recently read all of Robin Hobbs elderlings series, the kingkiller chronicals,  the witcher series, and all of Brandon Sandersons books, but I'm running out of ideas. I like books with some wit to them, I don't mean it has to be a comedy but at least a little bit of laughter or sarcasm. 

A big thing for me is I MUCH prefer books with only one POV. I know Sandersons books are the opposite of that, and I liked those enough, however I do prefer books that just narrated from a single perspective. 

I prefer  high medieval fantasy, but it definitely doesn't have to be elves/dwarves/humans. 

I absolutely LOVE books about the Fae, so bonus points if they're included!"
45,Fantasy,Books from the perspective of an Eldritch Abomination?,"I once read a book that was from the perspective of an eldritch abomination, or some equally inhuman being, and the way the author had conveyed that you were reading about a creature that was powerful, something more than just human, and was ancient and had seen so much just from how they talked about concepts everyone was familiar with, like love or shadows or darkness, in such an alien voice. 

So, I'm wondering if there are other books out there from an eldritch and/or ancient/alien perspective that makes you feel like you're reading about something that is both powerful, has seen so much, and is inhuman."
46,Fantasy,Little Red Riding Hood | The Original Fairy Tale,
47,Fantasy,Story with a morally good protagonist in a shitty world?,"I've been reading Ar'Kendrythist for a while, it's a webnovel that can be found on royalroad.com. What I love about it is that the world is pretty much a shithole, and yet the protagonist never loses his core of morality. 

The strongest mages are walking weapons of mass destruction and most of them are trying to make sure the world ends. Monsters run the gamut from ""will chomp you to death"" to infohazards that claim whole cities. And the gods are shit as well, with many of them involved in a forever war. 

So of course, the main character faces a lot of difficulty in keeping true to his morality. He starts off as a pacifist, and has to balance his desire for peace with making sure he and his own survives. And yes, he does have to commit acts outside of his moral boundaries. What I specifically loved about this story is that even through those acts, he doesn't let up on his self discipline. He doesn't start getting jaded and willing to commit worse acts. 

I'm looking for a story like that. With a main character with strong morals thrown into the worst the world has to offer. And by the end they come out with the same morals, more or less, just refined."

**Q&amp;A with Anthony**

***Thank you for agreeing to this Q&amp;A. Before we start, tell us a little about yourself.***

Thank you for hosting me! I’m a lover of all things fantasy and sci-fi, and since I’m from California’s Central Valley I’ve also become a big fan of the Western genre thanks to all the Gold Rush history out here. Just finished getting my degree in English literature a couple years ago after a long delay, did a year-long stint in Japan teaching English, and now I’m taking a shot at self-publishing my fantasy westerns!

***What brought you to*** r/fantasy? What do you appreciate about it?\*\*\*

I’ve been cruising through r/Fantasy for years and years, and I think what I appreciate the most is when I see some unique recommendations for some really underappreciated or underread works: like *The Last Hot Time* by John M. Ford, *Bone Dance* by Emma Bull, or *Malazan*.(Kidding.)

***Who are your favorite current writers and who are your greatest influencers?***

For favorite current writers: I’ve been really enjoying *The Expanse* series by the James S.A. Corey crew and the *Riyria* series by Michael J. Sullivan. As far as my greatest influencers: Matthew Stover taught me a lot about theming a story, the Westerns of Ron Hansen and Charles Portis taught me a lot about what the genre is truly capable of, and Timothy Zahn taught me how to drive a story forward effectively with dialogue. R.A. Salvatore also introduced me to the genre itself and made me enthused about writing in the first place, so his fingerprints are probably all over everything I write.

***How would you describe the plot of*** ***What Was Your Name Downriver?*** ***if you had to do so in just one or two sentences?***

In a high fantasy setting that’s advanced into an age of steam and gunslingers, two women meet aboard a riverboat that runs afoul of a wild mage before they can make it back to civilization. True to the mage’s title, things get a little too wild.

***How did you come up with the title*** ***What Was Your Name Downriver?***

Given the Western slant of the setting, I decided to have the title be a reference to an old American folk song called “What Was Your Name in the States?” There are some great renditions on YouTube and a short version can be found in Carl Sandburg’s *American Songbag.*

***How does it tie with the plot of the book?***

The song is about a man being asked who he was exactly before he fled the US and came to the western territories, implying that he had left behind (or fled) an old life to start over fresh. In *What Was Your Name Downriver?*, Evaline and Trivan are both trying to leave their old lives behind in the gold fields and attempting, albeit unsuccessfully so far, to begin again in more civilized locales.

**What inspired you to write this story? Was there one “lightbulb moment” when the concept for this book popped into your head or did it develop over time?**

Mostly over time. I’d been trying to write a “best of both worlds” western/fantasy for a while, using American myths, legends, and history as the foundation. When a short story I wrote ended up being published in a dark fantasy anthology called *Blackguards* along with some of my favorite fantasy authors, I doubled down Evaline Cartwright’s story. Trivan Esterhazy became a great foil for Evaline and a story about them meeting for the first time caught my interest. I poked at it for a few years, getting an outline going in the meantime, doing some research, and even writing the first few chapters.

But we had an abnormally long Golden Week in Japan due to the ascension of the new emperor and the beginning of the new Reiwa era, so I was really able to get things moving during all that free time.

**If you had to describe** ***What Was Your Name Downriver?*** **in 3 adjectives, which would you choose?**

Rootinest, tootinest, *and* shootinest!

**Would you say that** ***What Was Your Name Downriver?*** **follows tropes or kicks them?**

A bit of both. I think there will absolutely be a number of genre trappings that will be familiar to readers, mostly because I have to write what I love and those trappings are what I gravitate towards in settings like the Forgotten Realms or Dragon Age, for instance. I’m hoping, however, that the formula will bear out some unique situations that don’t lean on those tropes very much at all.

**Who are the key players in this story? Could you introduce us to** ***What Was Your Name Downriver?’*****’s protagonists/antagonists?**

Evaline “Calamity” Cartwright is a bounty hunter in one of the most lawless regions of the nation. She’s also a veteran of a war that closely resembled the American Civil War, until the enemy started using magick to blow up entire cities, raise their dead from the battlefields, and turn entire regiments to stone. The war left an impact on her, physically and mentally, and even ten years on she is still struggling with it when she meets Trivan.Meanwhile, Trivan Esterhazy is much younger, not nearly as streetwise or world-weary, but she’s also wrestling with some demons of her own and on that level the women start to gravitate towards each other. Trivan also has a no-nonsense view of the world and how things should be, which Evaline appreciates because she has long since lost her objectivity.

As for the antagonists, Evaline finds that paranoia and a bit of magick can make aggressors out of just about anyone on a rickety riverboat.

**Alright, we need the details on the cover. Who's the artist/designer, and can you give us a little insight into the process for coming up with it? How does it tie to the book?**

So, the cover art is actually a painting done in the 1800s titled “Through the Bayou by Torchlight” by Currier &amp; Ives. I’m a big fan of the paintings that came out of that company and this painting in particular struck the tone that I was going for. The cover design was done by my sister, Alexa, who helped me come up with the look that I’ll be carrying through the series.

**What was your proofreading/editing process?**

Rigorous! Even for a relatively short book, it required *several* late-night/early-morning passes. I see *WWYND* as an introduction, so I had to strike a balance between worldbuilding and character, while still keeping things economical. Western fantasy is still a niche genre, so I wanted everything to be palatable, even the length. In addition, my writing has a pretty heavy emphasis on dialogue, so keeping accents and lexicons consistent and making sure conversations felt natural was probably the biggest challenge.

**Which** r/fantasy **Bingo squares does it fit?**

* A novel featuring necromancy
* Self-published SFF (+ Hard Mode)
* A novel published in 2020
* A book that made you laugh (+ Hard Mode).

**What are you most excited for readers to discover in this book?**

I think the protagonists, most of all. Evaline and Trivan are the absolute focus and I hope that readers find them engaging enough to follow them through to the end, and potentially on into the sequels.

And also which parts actually lean on real history.

**Can you, please, offer us a taste of your book, via one completely out-of-context sentence.**

55,Fantasy,What Is Feminist SFF (with Recommendations),"This post was inspired by Charlotte Reads' [2020 review presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ziqUSPXCb391n1z18Tz9CQgp1uhNk3NuLp0wBIhSYgg/edit#slide=id.g7e8f9914bd_0_77). Thank you, /u/enoby666

The purpose of this post is to share some of my personal thoughts about the subject and hopefully spark some interesting discussion.

I also want to give some book recommendations and to hear yours. I’m also linking some previous recommendation threads and discussions in case you want to dive into the topic further.

**What is feminist SFF?** (in my opinion, formed by gender studies in a university)

Well, first you have to determine what feminism is.

- My kind of feminism aims for equality between all people, regardless of gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, abledness, neurodiversity etc. 

- Intersectionality is an important concept in feminism. It was coined in 1989 by Kimberle Crenshaw. 

- In the Western society, there is the idea of a basic human being. And often that person is thought to be a white, able, heterosexual, middle class man.

- Someone that differs from that concept of a “basic human” often faces bias and difficulties in their life. In the more ways they are different from the assumed norm, the more issues there are.

- Feminism also acknowledges the difference between sex and gender. Gender is not tied to our body and there are more than two genders. We are not born with a gender, we become gendered as we grow up as we learn the culture’s view of what gender we should belong to and how our gender should behave. Gender is a performance, a set of routines, for some more stable and permanent than for others. It might match your physical sex, or it might not.

---

**What is a feminist SFF book like?**

- A feminist book focuses on diverse characters that might normally not get a story, or that might not be the main character.

- It explores the concept of gender or some other differentiating aspect mentioned above.

- It also explores the power dynamics in the society and/or interpersonal relationships (the macro and micro level).

- Or it challenges the traditional narratives and tropes of fantasy (for example as stories of adventure and war)

In my personal opinion, if a book categorizes genders as a binary, with female and male as the only options, it can’t be 100% feminist, no matter its other merits. For example Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan holds such a gender essentialist view. In this world, gender is coded into your soul. Magic is divided by gender/soul. A male cannot channel saidar, a female cannot channel saidin.

If you define a feminist book differently, please post below and share your thoughts. Please also remember the subreddit rules and be kind.

---

**Some different ways how a book can be feminist**

- The absolute minimum requirement: There are female characters in the book and they talk to each other about something other than men (aka The Bechdel Test). (See /u/MikeOfThePalace ’s [analysis of some popular books](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/laais7/rfantasys_favorites_and_the_bechdel_test_by_the/) and whether they pass)

Passing The Bechdel Test alone is hardly enough and there are other, better measures to fill.

Such as:

- The female/POC/LGBTQ+/disabled characters are cool and awesome in some way that makes you relate (or not relate and that makes you to think)

- It challenges the status quo of the society shown in the book

- It challenges the views of the reader

------

I’m listing some possible categories below, and share some book recommendations for each of them. 

I can’t possibly include all the deserving representatives for each category. So I really hope that you all will shout out your recommendations and favourites.

My knowledge of sci fi is weaker than my fantasy fu so please help me out with sci fi recs especially. 

One book might fit many different categories so please list all that apply.

Also, do let me know if you have opinions about the categories. Are there some that don’t belong, some that should be added?

56,Fantasy,Brine-y Bingo Blackout - Second Row mini reviews!,"*Ghost:* **Dead Voices (Small Spaces #2) by Katherine Arden** 4/5 - Ollie's dad has won a free weekend at the grand opening of a ski lodge, so of course her friends Coco and Brian are along for the trip. Unfortunately on the way a storm kicks up, they barely arrive, winding up the only guests to reach the lodge for the weekend, and are immediately snowed in. Things get immediately weird and the adults are clueless, the power goes, then the generators. The trio must navigate a dark, cold lodge (that they learn is of course formerly an ill-fated orphanage) full of spooky sights and sounds, hoping they can outsmart the darkness there using all they learned the previous fall. 

Arden is a absolute master of atmosphere and setting, which is perfect for this sort of tale, get ready to hunker down with some cocoa when you read this chilly tale. 


*Exploration:* **Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern** 4/5 - Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a normal university student, a bit bookish, nerdy gamer friends. Until he finds an uncatalogued book in the library with a section that includes himself. This sets him on a journey collecting other books, finding a secret society, and even figuring out what the starless sea may be. Betwixt all this, we have passages of other books, heavily symbolic, as well as several random interludes. 

The writing is beautiful, the story dreamlike, I liked it... but I don't know if I could tell you what this was really about?



*Climate Fiction* **The Last Day by Andrew Hunter Murray** 3.5/5 - In 2019 earth's rotation began slowing, by 2059 it's now been 3 decades since the Stop, half the earth is buried in darkness and ice, Britain is a small bastion of near normal life continuing. Ellen Hopper is an Oceanogapher, probably the only one in existence, living on a ship for the past 4 years without a care to return to land until some shadowy government operatives show up to collect her at the request of her estranged former mentor, who is on his deathbed, when she gets there he gives her a cryptic message.

I really wanted this to lean into the science, the author is well suited to write that, but instead it went much more toward traditional thriller. I was most intrigued by hearing how different countries dealt with the changes in the day cycle, as well as the occasional descriptions of sunlit nights being super eerie.


*Colour in the Title:* **Gods of Jade and Shadow by Silvia Moreno Garcia** 4/5 - Ever since her father's death, Casiopea and her mother have lived with her wealthy grandfather. That is until in his house she discovers a chest full of bones and pricks herself with a shard of bone, awaking Hun-Kame lord of Xibalba. Immediately she is dragged involuntarily along on his journey from Mexico to Baja California, collecting the missing body parts his brother scattered when he was imprisoned in the chest. However, his brother and Casiopea's familial nemesis are on their heels to stop Hun-Kame recovering his rule of Xibalba.

This is very much a journey novel, I love that we get a fair amount of train travel. They experience small towns and deserts and big cities and festivals - along the way meeting up with mythical friends and enemies - weaving in a heavy dose of real historical context of what was happening in 1920s Mexico &amp; setting explanations along the way. I found it wonderful that a huge piece of this is that once you journey, you are changed and can never go back as things were before.


*Book Club:* **Ghost Story (Dresden Files #13) by Jim Butcher** 2/5 - Basically everything I could say about the plot is a spoiler, I feel like the whole point of this (rather long) book was just to get across that people are emotionally damaged when they lose people they care about. Mostly felt unnecessary to the series over all.

57,Fantasy,Why You Should Try Bingo - My First Year and Filled Out Hard Mode Card,"I, like many folks, had a bit extra time on my hands this year. So I joined in the Bingo for the first time. I want to share a few thoughts and also how my own card turned out.

/r/fantasy's Book Bingo Challenge is really great if you: 

* want to read some new things
* want to read some favorite things
* want to share your experiences with others (especially the BotM read-togethers for Hard Mode)
* like gamification

I'd say the only drawback of the Bingo Challenge is the amount of books you need to read, but this year that wasn't such a big issue. 

[My finished card](https://imgur.com/TXfmkva) - all hard mode, all hero mode since I review everything on goodreads. 

My favorite parts of the book bingo were (in no particular order):

* Joining in the book of the month (BotM) read-togethers. I hadn't joined these before either, and I have to say I did really miss more in depth book discussions. 
* I read far more interesting books than I would have probably picked up on my own (Kalpa Imperial being the stand out)
* I learned a lot more about Canadian small presses and what kinds of books they publish. I hope to use one one day of research and knowledge in a trivia game one day.
* It turns out I read a *lot* more of some categories (optimistic, romance, feminist, school/uni)...
* ...and like *nothing* of others (audiobooks, climate / apocalypse - but who can blame me after our last collective year?)
* What is a BDO?
* What even is a ""pet"" anyway!?

But overall I have to say this was really fun. I'm so happy that it's a recurring thing, and I'll try to join from now on. I don't know if I'll always be able to do hard mode (some of those were *really* hard to find/finish). 

These books were very enjoyable and I recommend highly: **A Conspiracy of Truths** by Alexandra Rowland, **The Starless Sea** by Erin Morgenstern, **The Ten Thousand Doors of January** by Alix E Harrow

Please just throw these out, burn them, or delete them from existence: Tracks by K M Tolan (I hate read Every. Last. Word.), Cinderella is Dead by Kalynn Bayron - both of them suffer from too many cliches, not enough editor, and far too much YA-tropes.

I can't wait for the next Bingo! Maybe I should just not read anything until it's announced?"
58,Fantasy,Corpies by Drew Hayes - Fantastic spin off to Super Powereds 4.5/5,"4.5/5

CORPIES is a spin-off of Drew Hayes' SUPER POWEREDS series but can read as a stand-alone. I read the Super Powereds series first and really enjoyed it, so I was interested in picking this up. I'm also a fan of Drew Hayes' other series like FRED THE VAMPIRE ACCOUNTANT and VILLAINS' CODE. So, I was eager to pick this one up. I actually think this is probably my second favorite of his works as Villain's Code just barely edges it out.

The premise is that the hero formerly known as Titan has returned. Titan quit being a superhero a decade ago due to the fact he was outed as a gay man during a time when it was less accepted than now. It wasn't doubly ugly because he was married with children at the time. Inspired to return, his reputation is still mud and he has to join with a band of corporate sponsored rescue workers (PEERS if you're being polite, CORPIES if you're not) instead of proper Heroes. 

Corpies are basically the Minor Leagues of superheroes and Titan is resentful of being stuck with them. If I were to draw a comparison, it's like if Superman returned out of retirement and was forced to join the Great Lakes Avengers. I really like this premise because while Titan holds prejudice against the idea of corporate-sponsored superheroism, he's polite and professional about it for the most part. The PEERS heroes are not jokes, either. They may not have degrees in heroism but they're all decent people who have proper power-sets. It just wasn't quite enough to get them into the big leagues or they had complications.

This is a bit more action packed as a series than Super Powereds and Villain's Code both, focusing on the emergency work that the city of Brewster needs. This includes frequent robot attacks, super-powered gang warfare, and Powereds losing control of their abilities. I actually didn't think this was necessary because I was enjoying the slice of life stories that came with being a corporate hero. I liked all the publicity, public relations snafus, and other things designed to promote them as celebrities capable of raising their sponsor's status.

I'm far from alone but my favorite character in the book is easily Hexcellent. A Goth girl summoner who is aware that she's beloved by marketing for her sex appeal as much as her ability to create enormous magical constructs, 
Hexcellent is a character tailor made for me. I can't say I disliked any of the main team, though. I also liked the sex scandal with Bubble Bubble, too, who has to deal with her good girl image being smashed by an ex-lover. Frankly, I think it was a bit too mild of a scandal and anyone could have taken care of it let alone our hero's super-agent.

One thing I like about Corpies is the fact that it is one of the rare depictions of corporations in media where they're not pure evil. As much as I'm an enemy of late stage capitalism as any First Worlder can be, I do think it gets a bit tiresome seeing executives engaged in nefarious ne'er do wellery. So it's nice to see the corporates really just want to try to increase our heroes' brand and don't mind if they do a bunch of good on the side. Hell, they encourage it since it's good business not to lose the city they're based in. 

If I had any problem with the story, I would have appreciated some more insight into the timing and nature of Titan's fall. If the book is set in the timeline of the book's release, Titan's fall was somewhere around 2000 and gay/straight relations have changed a lot since then. I would have liked to have known what specifically people felt about it a bit more and how they reacted to his return. Then again, maybe that's asking a bit much for a fun popcorn book. As such, this is also formatted in a somewhat odd way that readers should be warned of beforehand.

In conclusion, I really liked this book and am kind of sad that it didn't become a full-fledged alternative series to Super Powereds."

60,Fantasy,Charlotte Reads: Piranesi by Susanna Clarke," *“In my mind are all the tides, their seasons, their ebbs and their flows.”* 

**So What’s It About?**

Piranesi’s house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.

There is one other person in the house—a man called The Other, who visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known.

**What I Thought**

You might think you have an understanding of the story given its synopsis, but I will gladly tell you right now: this is a book whose summary does it little justice. You have to read it yourself to understand what is so incredibly unique about it. A significant part of it is that Piranesi himself is an extraordinary and wonderful person to spend time with throughout the pages. He is, quite simply, so good – full of selflessness, generosity, gratitude, curiosity and wonder. There are so many little touches that make Piranesi the wonderful person that he is, from his earnest care for the dead of the House to his kindness towards the birds and statues to his all-encompassing love for the House itself and how it provides for him.

Another significant part of it is the idiosyncrasy of the narration and the writing style. Piranesi is a remarkable person and he has a remarkable voice. I loved the Capitalization of Nouns related to the House, the framing device of the journal entries and the precise, scientific details. I loved the utter creativity of the story that gets puzzled together over the course of the book. I don’t think I want to spoil anything about that in this review – it’s best left for each reader to discover on their own.

And, because Piranesi loves it, I still love the House in all its strange beauty – the sealife and clouds, the stars and moon, the tides, the Halls and Vestibules and Stairs and endless variations of Statues, crumbling and cracked and covered in coral. It is a vast and ancient place, mysterious but not malevolent, and it’s written so wondrously that you understand exactly why people long to return once they leave. Speaking of &gt;!leaving!&lt;, the ending of *Piranesi* is absolutely beautiful and bittersweet.

I know this book will not be for everyone but it was entirely and decidedly for me. I’m just glad that I still have *The Ladies of Grace Adieu* to tide me over until Clarke’s next book."

62,Fantasy,Question about something in 'Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell',"Hi folks! I just finished Susanna Clarke's masterpiece. I loved it, but I had one question that I can't seem to resolve

I attempted to post this on the work-specific thread: r/JSandMN, but sadly that thread is specifically for the BBC television adaptation. (Also, please let me know if this sub is not the right place, either).

In any case: earlier in the novel, when some characters were discussing how to free Stephen, Lady Pole, and Arabella from enchantment, it was invoked that if the entity who performed the enchantment were vanquished, then it would free those under enchantment from their bonds.

While this did prove true for Stephen (Lady Pole and Arabella were freed in different ways), Strange remained in the Darkness through the end of the novel, even though Stephen killed the Gentleman.

I still can't reconcile how the Gentleman died, but his enchantment on Strange (and later Norrell) remained intact.

Did I miss something?"
63,Fantasy,Short stories I read online (for free) in Feb 2021,"This is my first post on Reddit so apologies in advance for any errata.

I used to think short stories weren’t for me, and when I was trying to get into them I started a collection that just made me feel dumb. However, I’ve since done an about turn and now gobble them down like mental candy.

I wanted to try and do a brief summary of the fantastical shorts I read this month that stuck with me for one reason or another, to share the love and maybe find some fellow short story fans 😊 All of these I read online for free and I’ve provided links to.

Again, I’m not sure how much this blurs SF/F, but I found this a nice, overall feel-good story, where a retired superhero gets tangled in one last job that goes messy.

Duels are all well and good, but wouldn’t you rather eat food? Do both with this story, another enjoyable, low-stakes piece.

**Loosestrife by Marissa Lingen** \- [https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-decameron-35656049](https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-decameron-35656049)

The plot was a little unsatisfying for my preferences, but this was outweighed by the amusement I got from the talking goats.

Probably more horror than fantasy, but it felt like cute horror, which is definitely a subgenre I’ll dip my scaredy-cat toe into.

If you’re looking for a light, feel-good story, this isn’t the one; Ramdas draws on history, specifically British colonisation of Indian during the Second World War, in a story that’s both unsettling and eye-opening if you’re ignorant of history like me.

I really liked the world-building concepts in this story, after having my attention hooked by the word tea-fish, and this story focused on community and resilience.

64,Fantasy,A Review of The First Sister by Linden A. Lewis: Some thoughts on thematic storytelling,"This book is about waking up to harsh realities, even if you thought you were well acquainted with reality to begin with. 

This is a science fiction book, set at some point in the future within the solar system. Humanity had nearly destroyed Earth through over exploitation and even seriously damaged  Mars which was a colony. This resulted in war and chaos.  Tired of the turmoil,  a scientific faction had left for Venus and Mercury and were able to colonize both and build technological utopias there. When the book takes place there are two mutually hostile factions of humanity - the Icarii of Venus and Mars who are heavily reliant on technology and genetic manipulation and the Gaens of Earth and Mars who are an odd combination of a military dictatorship and a theocracy. There also exists a third faction called the Asters who live in deep space and are physically distinctive from the other two. 

The book shifts between two principal points of view with  a series of interjections scattered among them. One PoV character is the titular First Sister. The Sisterhood is the primary religious section of the Gaen civilization and state. Sisters are women trained from a young age to act as confessors, comforters and sexual companions to the armed forces. They are literally voiceless, they cannot speak. Their duties are to attend to the spiritual and physical needs of any soldier at any time. The First Sister however is an exception, she is “reserved” for the use of the captain of the warship on which she is stationed. Aside from the sisters, there is an “Agora” of Aunts who are the governing authorities of the various orders of sisters and a Mother who is the head of the Sisterhood. The Mother and Aunts wield real power. The second PoV character is Icarii, the soldier and paired Duellist, Lito. A military veteran, he is recovering from a mission when he is recalled once again to duty. 

The book is very evenly paced and quite action packed. It ably weaves the characters into their distinctive worlds. But to me the most appealing part of the book was thematic symmetry of the story. At first glance, The First Sister and Lito could not be more different. Their storylines progress differently. To start with, Lito retains some faith in the Icarii system and in his own mission. Though he is being torn apart by the effects of older events on the inside, on the outside he is a devoted and capable agent. But with every step he takes, he realizes the reality he believed in, the basic assumptions of his life - all are open to question. Lito’s story is like a confused downward spiral, full of unanswered questions, desperate to find something that makes sense. The First Sister on the other hand is well aware of her position, its essential insecurity and the vicious, predatory nature of the system in which she resides. Even as she desperately tries to construct ways of coping with it, she is under no illusion about how close she teeters to the edge. And yet, there are dark truths that swim below the surface, truths that are only hinted at to start with, but as they make themselves known, everything starts to unravel. Ultimately both our protagonists have to realize and accept that the reality they knew was but a veneer and if they are to go on, they must make fundamental changes. 

Overall I quite enjoyed this book. It was an interesting approach to space warfare and politics and the story contains skillfully depicted LGBTQA+ elements. Chapters also have in-universe epigraphs that add context and emphasis to various elements of the story. 

Anyone who prefers more character oriented military science fiction would love this book. 

I will definitely be picking up future books from the author.

69,Fantasy,Evil in Fantasy,"[https://youtu.be/z0NgUhEs1R4](https://youtu.be/z0NgUhEs1R4)

So, I have been toying with this idea in fantasy for a while, but the post below about domestic violence in fantasy prompted me to bring it to the table for discussion. I linked the SNL skit above because it gets at part of what the central issues of what I am saying is. 

We talk about how Sauron style supervillains are boring. They have no motivation but power and therefore very little character. This is typically said as an offhand manner of dismissing the villainy of Classic High Fantasy. MCU movies get this dismissal too (not to mention their overuse of skybeams). Instead, the push in writing seems to be the ""everyone is a hero of their own story"" adage. Villains should look like good guys when we get in their head, per se. Jaime Lannister is probably the character that most brought this idea to fantasy, though Tad Williams' Norns did a lot to provide legitimate motivation to the actions of the 'evil' race. Currently, I think a lot of fantasy Grimdark has taken this to new morally grey territory, particularly Joe Abercrombie and Mark Lawrence. Now, I am not dismissing these authors' books. I enjoy them immensely, and think the issue lies more with how villainy in them is read than how it is presented. 

The other push has been to 'make the villain interesting'. Your villain needs to have personality and flavor and not just be mustache twirling or horned helmet bad guy. All of this is interesting and I think has lent us a crop of recent villains who are interesting and fun to read while embodying morally grey motivations behind typically good motivations (The characters in Kuang's PoppyWars Saga seem to fit here. As do, again, many of Abercrombie's villains.) 

Now, I think these new trends tell us much about the morally complicated and grey nature of warfare and particularly historical geopolitical disputes, a topic which typically gives us fantasy's major setpieces. That being said, what does it tell us about evil and villainy? How well does it hold up a mirror to humanity and to our world? Because I look from literary sympathetic, complicated villains to our world and it is here that I see cookie cutter villainy. 

Domestic abuse and spousal sexual assaults have increased in the United States in the last decade, as has the rate that those events end in homicide. I see almost nothing morally grey here. 

Domestic white supremacist groups are on the rise and present, according to the FBI, a greater terror threat than foreign terrorism. 

No matter what side of the political aisle you are on, in the US or abroad, I am sure you will agree that many politicians lie and fearmonger and push harmful policies to further their own political interests. 

The very very rich continually throughout history corrupt political systems and turn, when able, economic systems towards greater and greater inequality. 

I in no way want a political debate and if you disagree with one of my examples, please disregard my example in light of the larger point. The desire for power, wealth, influence, and control seems to me to be at the root of the evil we actually deal with in our world. So why do we find it derivative and unrealistic in our fantasy? To me, even those who are personally sympathetic (the father of three working man who lost his job at the plant) either succumb to or come to prefer empowering ideologies of rage that salve their insecurities and, to me, lose their sympathies (when that father turns his unemployment into drink and then to jealousy and eventual battery of his wife) or lose their moral ambiguity (when he becomes radicalized by online hate groups and eventually engages in hate crimes against minorities). 

There are ideologies and actions that stem from those ideologies that are reasonably unambiguous once the facts are laid out. What becomes complicated is worldview and what people believe. In other words, if we want sympathetic villains, they are ones who are literally wrong because they fall victim to the lies and propaganda of the powerful, not just on the other side of a conflict. I feel like I do not see this issue explored enough in fantasy. But I also feel like primarily unsympathetic villains are okay too. Again, men who routinely engage in the terrorizing and assaults of their domestic partners, once you lay out their behaviors and roots, are often bad cliches whose quest for control has eaten through most other parts of their personality. Dictators fit similar paths to power and actions once empowered. Political opportunists do as well. 

In other words, I was hoping to discuss this on here. 

I guess, first, whether or not anyone agrees with me or feels a need to infuse new kinds of villainy into fantasy.

Do you think there is an issue with how we read villainy and evil in epic fantasy? 

Would more authentic kinds of evil in fantasy lead to more complicated narratives and enrich the genre?

Thank you all very much for your time. This subreddit feels like coming home to me and I love the discussion and the passion for fantasy here. It seriously means a lot to me."

88,Fantasy,The Sword of Kaigen &gt; The Poppy War,"I probably shouldn't compare because these two are very different books, but I read both back to back and I can't help it.

As much as I love a good world building, which both books have, I feel MORE when I'm attached to characters so I'm going to focus on that. 

Misaki and Mamorou, albeit very frustrating, are characters you actually want to root for. Their character arcs, even Takeru's, are very well realized that you don't question their sincerity. They feel so raw that it feels as though you've meet a lot of people like them.

Rin and Altan felt shallow in comparison to that. TPW may not be as character-driven as TSOK but Rin &amp; Altan aren't even likeable. Likeable characters arent the standard of a good book, but when you have NO character to want to root for, reading that book will be a miseribale experience no matter how much you love grimdark.


One is a cautionary tale about blind nationalism &amp; war while the other brings to light the exhilarating feeling of revenge one may feel upon executing a genocide.

#Blurb

(from goodreads)

*Ren is a con artist who has come to the sparkling city of Nadežra with one goal: to trick her way into a noble house, securing her fortune and her sister's future.*

*But as she's drawn into the elite world of House Traementis, she realizes her masquerade is just one of many surrounding her. And as nightmare magic begins to weave its way through the City of Dreams, the poisonous feuds of its aristocrats and the shadowy dangers of its impoverished underbelly become tangled…with Ren at their heart.*

#Review

I listened on audio and am not going to look up spellings just yet so please forgive me for writing names however. 

* Ok so right away, I absolutely loved this book. I read it right after finishing Rhythm of War and *wow* the lush prose was the contrast I needed.   
* This book is very sexy. Not as in explicitly erotic (there's very little of that, actually), but there's just a certain je-ne-sais-quoi about many of the main characters, the worldbuilding, the intrigue and the dialogue.   
* The MC's sister main ally is also her seamstress and I really appreciated the tailoring details and how clothing is used as a tool in the series  
* The magic in this one is on the more subtle side (there's *imbuing* as a concept, which is basically mostly ""magically enhanced"" items of all sorts), but I really liked the role and use of Pattern (a Tarot-like card system)  
* I've been looking for a book with a good ""masked vigilante who fights for the poor and disenfranchised by sassily duelling arrogant nobles"" character and let me tell you the itch has been *scratched*. The Rook and his actions are perhaps not *the* core plot of the book, but the mystery of his identity and his interractions with Ren were absolutely delicious. And my guess to who he was flip-flopped multiple times while reading.   
* Although the setup of the book is mostly about social intrigue and political power, it grows more ""classically fantasy"" in the second half when the perviously foreshadowed supernatural threat makes its proper appearance. These two aspects were well balanced and interwoven imo, with interesting conflict being created out of how Ren's social leverage is tied to her personas and not her own self, which bites her in the ass a bit at some points. 
* An unexpected strength of the book were how the relationships between Ren (or rather her Renata Veraudax persona) and her marks/allies develop (meaning Denaia, Juna and Leato mostly, but also Vargo...), with some delicious conflict arising from her being torn between genuinely helping them and still very much lying to them about her own identity. 
* Speaking of Vargo: fucking love him. Best character. Former (ongoing?) crime lord turned big player, who uses his charm and body to get what he wants, who is so fucking extra that he has a pet spider up his sleeve but also has some sort of spirit possession thing going on? We love to see it. An absolute delight to read. 
* Edit, something I forgot: there are a lot of names, titles and locations thrown at you at the beginning. Combined with the fact that the world uses it's own calendar, it took me a long time to be sure when I was looking at a month, place or person.

#Discussion (spoilers are tagged)

* I am very curious about Ren's future as &gt;!""The Rose"", considering the series is called ""Rook and Rose"". Taking on an identity/role obviously comes naturally to her and I can totally see ""the Rose"" filling a role that is somehow more ""Ren"" than either Renata or Arenza.!&lt;
* I felt very vindicated to learn the Rook's identity (although I like that &gt;!Ren doesn't know it yet!&lt;) because although I seriously considered &gt;!Leato and Vargo as options when Ren did, Grey was actually my very first guess, and Vargo would NOT have been a good fit imo!&lt;  
* The part where &gt;!Ren cannot sleep after the Night of Hells!&lt; is wonderfully horrifying. It's at once completely nightmarish and yet oddly relatable to me, and I loved the way it was written, especially since &gt;!so much of Ren/Renata's whole deal relies on her being in control, and quick-witted, and that the magic insomnia threatens to ruin that for her was beautifully scary!&lt;.   
* I was very excited at the very end when &gt;!Ren realizes that Vargo has been playing her all along, and that he actually caused the fire that killed Grey's brother!&lt;. I love Vargo, but I think he works best as a &gt;!dubious ally rather than a reliable one, and this realization that he's been using her for his own gain can only mean more delicious relationship development in the next two books!&lt;. That being said, I also think &gt;!Ren's realization isn't entirely accurate, since Vargo genuinely seems to have been sorry about his sending Renata to the Night of Hells!&lt;, but then of course Ren doesn't know that, so again: delicious conflict.

93,Fantasy,Looking to read something different with my 2.5 year old,"What were you read as young children that helped fuel your love for fantasy?  


My two and a half year old loves being read to.  He'll often plant himself on the floor or in his teepee and flick through his books or read (mostly gibberish) to his teddies.  While I am loving working through all his shorter stories (a couple a night) my goal one day, when he is old enough, is to read him the Hobbit, Harry Potter etc. over a series of nights.

  
Is there anything we could enjoy for the moment, along the fantasy lines, that may be read over a night or two and that is illustrated so it holds his attention and allows him to follow the story?  His biggest favourites at the moment are any of the Julia Donaldson/Axel Scheffler collaborations and books from the Usborne Phonics series, so loves a bouncy rhyme.  UK based if that matters."

99,Fantasy,Help Recommend Me New Series?,"Hi,

I've been loving fantasy lately and am at an impasse. I just read the Broken Earth trilogy and it was so amazingly good that it made me feel like a lot of the previous fantasy I had enjoyed was too light and kind of childish, among other flaws. I would love other recommendations

Here are some of the series I have liked (Happy to talk about any of them):

Broken Earth: short and sweet, just amazing, the very best

Foundation series-enjoyed this a lot and love Asimov.

SOIAF: This was good but too drawn out and introduced too many divergent plots, I grew disinterested by book 5 and it stopped feeling like it was worth the effort of reading. This is also a little gratuitous for me and I didn't really find the characters believable 

Stormlight archives/Cosmere: very fun books, enjoyed them a lot. feels kind of aimed at a younger audience perhaps (at times) and never interests me thematically (Sanderson never does), despite which I'm still a big Sanderson fan and have read everything in the cosmere. The fun factor is there and the twists are enjoyable. I don't really consider this to be the same genre as something like broken earth

Lord of the rings: loved this. obviously

re:zero web novel: enjoy this a lot despite the usual anime weirdness

Can't say I'm a prolific fantasy reader so this is about everything. Hoping to get recommendations for something new that will fit my tastes!"
100,Fantasy,Series where the dragons are actually bad guys?,"Looking for a book series where the dragons are evil. Like they can be smart or just animalistic.

I know dragons are the oldest creature in the genre. Surprisingly a lot of the fantasy books I read have dragons as friends or a race of smart creatures that help or we need them for something.

Or we get the hobbit type of dragon.

Where are the evil, vicious dragons? Where’re are the beast dragons like if Drogon from Game of Thrones was even bigger and killed everyone near him?"
101,Fantasy,A Year in Fantasy: The Dragonbone Chair by Tad Williams,"So, I finished The Dragonbone Chair for the second time.  I'm glad I chose to come back to this series. With the third book in the Last King of Osten Ard trilogy set to be released this November, I figured I would go back to the original Osten Ard novels as a way to prepare.  


This time around, knowing where the series ends up, I was able to pick up on several small pieces of setup that pay off later in the trilogy. It amazes me how good Tad is at planting seeds early on without the reader noticing. Even stuff that in retrospect is super obvious.  


The slow start no longer bothered me, because I knew for sure that great stuff was to come. I was able to sit back and read the first couple of hundred pages, appreciating the way Tad sets the scene and also able to follow all the intrigue and tension happening behind the scenes, away from Simon's direct awareness.  


Also, I'd forgotten how good a writer Tad is. His prose is both precise and eloquent. He's not afraid of going into lengthy sentences, but these flow and give a good sense of atmosphere. He is more on the wordy side, considering how a lot of modern fantasy tends to be more concise and simple, but that's the type of prose I love.  


On to the next one!"

103,Fantasy,Happy International Women's Day! Who are some of your favorite women in SF/F?,"Feel free to discuss some of the women (fictional or otherwise) who have wowed you in speculative fiction! I'll start:

=

**Isabella Camherst nee Hendemore (The Memoirs of Lady Trent):**

This is possibly one of my favorite characters of all time, not just when it comes to women. I absolutely loved how Isabella goes from wide-eyed (albeit stubborn) noblewoman to becoming more introspective and thoughtful over her lifetime, even as she encounters cultures entirely alien to her and learns to accept and coexist with them.

=

**Vu Con (In the Vanishers' Palace):**

Vu Con is one of those characters I found really interesting. Not only is she a dragon, she's a shapeshifting healer dragon and adoptive mother of two. And one struggling to overthrow the shackles of colonial legacy too! I loved how Aliette de Bodard depicted her initially as a cruel, capricious godlike being, and then slowly strips that away to reveal that beneath the draconic exterior, she's just a woman trying to be a better person. 

=

**Baru Cormorant (Masquerade):**

The star of my favorite book! Baru is so, so relatable; I loved how she's a colonized islander trying to break the system from within. But what I found really relatable was her depression -- that mirrored mine on the worst of days and whenever I genuinely had it bad, it was a comfort knowing that someone (even fictional) could put words to how I felt right then.

=

**Elma York nee Wexler (Lady Astronaut):**

Another flawed character I love. Elma starts off a little unaware of privilege (especially with regards to Black social issues and rights) but what I adored about her is that she tries to learn from them moving forward, and always attempts to do good, even if she can be clumsy about it. I also like that she's a happily married woman who constantly communicates with her partner -- I don't often see such depictions in SF/F and I appreciate them being out there.

=

What about you? Who are some of the women or femme-presenting people you would highlight? I'd like to take a moment to highlight my fellow r/fantasy mods here; they do great work, they're excellent friends and comrades and I could not ask for a better team to work with!"

109,Fantasy,The Shadow of What Was Lost is a baby WoT?,"So I just picked The Eye of the World weeks ago and loved it. I can not stop comparing it to Lord of the Rings (it was so similar and upon researching, I finally understood why). I did enjoy it and am very excited to pick the Great Hunt. The people here were so great in motivating and making me excited to read the next installments in the series. Thank you so much.

Now, I read James Islington's works last year (except the finale, cause I'm about to read it next month) and I noticed also bits and pieces of similar elements to Wheel of Time (*cough *north *cough boundaries). I'm a big fan of the Licanius trilogy and thought that James did a great job writing yhe first two books of the trilogy.

Anyway, yeah, The Shadow of Whag Was Lost seems to be a baby Eye of the World but is on its way, a different league. But I can say the inspiration for those gem of a good books to be written are pretty obvious 🤗. And I am not complaining. 

I am currently reading literary fiction, The Prettiest Star and after this I will pick The Great Hunt."

111,Fantasy,Recs similar to Uprooted but better,"I ready uprooted this past week. It was a good transitional book for me (coming from romance). Overall it was enjoyable but I'm hoping to find something a bit more mature -- characters that are older and have more dimension and a plot that goes a bit deeper. For example, the book could've (should've imo) explored the way magic works a bit more. 

I enjoyed the Novik's writing style as it wasn't dense, more lyrica,l and higher quality than trash romance. It was digestible. I don't like lengthy descriptions. The more dialogue the better!

I think finding a duology would be a good next step for me.
Thanks for the recs :D"
112,Fantasy,Absolutist rulers - why are they so glorified in fantasy?,"I have struggled, and sometimes stopped, reading fantasy lately because so many stories fetishize, or at least cheerfully condone, absolutist rule. So both a plead for better fantasy governments and a question, why do stories, based in magic and the imagination, glorify a governance that is contrary (I hope) to it's readers values?

I think this is often tied to a Chosen One trope, which I find problematic as it undermines the idea that a person can achieve their dreams while justifying values of nepotism and righteous entitlement. But my issue with both is very similar.

The point I see most for it: historically, there were absolute rulers, so it's contextual. My pushback here is two fold, A) actual monarchies where often checked and there are plenty of better governments to reference instead; and B) fantasy is just that, fantasy, why is it important to be limited to dictatorships?  If it doesn't matter to the story, why default to a divine king? And if it does matter, why portray it as the preferred governance, instead of the Greek democracy, Roman republic, historic parliaments of Europe, Iroquois Confederacy, etc?

In my disillusionment, I find the idea of a benevolent king objectionable, it literally fantasizes about a ruler who could do great harm but doesn't. In stories, the constraints to absolutism seems more often portraited the villain (ie. corrupt court, advisor, republic, etc). While a perfect republic may be an idealization, so is a benevolent king, and the former seems a healthier fantasy.

Lastly, especially in fantasy, stories should push forward new ideas. Why are there dwarf kings and elf queens whose family claims the mountain or forest? It could just as easily be a round table of elders, a consult of the tested wise, a telepathic discussion with everyone, or jury of those affected?

I realize this topic was tread here a few years ago ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/aechb8/why_do_so_many_fantasy_series_portray_absolute/)), but I bring it back up as I feel the world context has changed, from the protesters being shot in Myanmar, the disturbing actions of the Saudi Prince, and in western countries, surveys show support rising for strongmen and democratic ideas falling. Given all this, I want to know why we glorify absolute dictators in our fantasies?"
113,Fantasy,An Unexpected Joy,"I'm a principal of an alternative high school and serve a disproportionately high number of LGBTQIA+ students who've time and again received the explicit message of ""You don't belong."" When doing my intake interviews, students regularly report imagined futures with lifespans of roughly 30 years full of misery, rejection, and isolation. You get the gist - these kids deserve exponentially better yet struggle to even see their own worth.

Enter Seannan McGuire. I've heard it argued by many a fantasy fan that her works are among the best representations of queer &amp; trans youth in the genre - and I'm hard pressed to argue. My students, once introduced, read her work voraciously and with reverie. While far from the sum total of the antecedents here, it's unquestionable that reading these books - and our club-based discussion her works - has had a huge impact in helping my kids pivot from hopelessness &amp; fear to a place of hope and excitement with trepidation. Big stuff, right?

Now the bonus: Last week, though circumstances I'll not get too into the weeds on, I discover that she's my effing neighbor!!! 

A) I'm psyched af

115,Fantasy,Need Help Finding a Book Again,"Hey there, I need your help tracking down a book series I read a while ago and want to revisit (and Google is being of no help). Now, obviously, in describing the story I'm going to drop spoilers. I apologize in advance but, y'know, how can I not describe the plot right?

Okay, so the premise of the book is that the main character finds out he's destined to become an evil lich and gets an instruction manual on how to be evil and all of the advice is classic ""evil-genius"" stuff and very obviously given with the intent of the hero winning the day (the book even mentions that he's supposed to lose if memory serves). Oh, and it turns out that his biological father is a dragon who sometimes sleeps around so he's sometimes an undead dragon as well. 

Meanwhile the hero is some borderline crazy dude who doesn't really get what's going on and spends most of the story completely unable to grasp reality. He even decapitates the lady in the lake who hands him the ""sword of destiny"" and somehow thinks it's because of the ""great evil"". The books are overall comedic in tone, there's a dragon that gets addicted to drugs, the main character invents kebabs, a guy dies because of fiery diarrhea, etc. 

There are lots of other things but those are the broad strokes, please help me!"
116,Fantasy,Silly Tropes/Pet-Peeves in books you otherwise have loved,"What are some silly/ridiculous ideas that you've seen crop up over and over in scifi or fantasy books,  which seem cool conceptually but would be terrible ideas in actuality,  in book that you've otherwise loved? 

My favorite (un-favorite??)  is the whole: ""Link soldiers/pilots together so they feel each other's feelings and see each others perspective"".

My god, this is a frickin' TERRIBLE idea.    But it keeps showing up in scifi over and over.     In two of my favorites:  *Old Man's War/Ghost-Brigades*, and more recently, in *A Desolation Called Peace*.

I've never been in actual combat where people were shooting bullets at me,  but I've done ROTC training and I've done some orienteering and mountaineering,  the former of which were stressful as hell and the latter of which were genuinely dangerous.  

I didn't even want to feel my own body's sensations while I was doing those things.    I wished that I could shut everything out and have it just be me and the rifle and the gunsights, and nothing else exist.  or just me and my gloves and the climbing rope and pitons, and absolutely nothing else.    Just feeling my own body's countless complaints  as I started getting tired and adrenaline started failing to cover those sensations was distracting enough.  

I can't imagine how distracting feeling the sensations or, god forbid, vision and viewpoints of others would be.  It'd be a complete fucking disaster.    When you need to focus and do something dangerous really fast, you want *less* sensations distracting you, not more. 

But the whole ""shared perception = better in combat"" keeps showing up over and over anyway.  I guess I don't really mind, it's like an established Scifi trope at this point.   

What are your favorite/un-favorite ideas or tropes in Scifi/Fantasy that would be utterly terrible ideas in real life?"

And it's not just humanoids. What is a good weapon against a dragon? What is a good weapon against a flying fire imp? Any culture that has regular, deadly contact with another species is going to invent weapons to make the job easier and these weapons may be inefficient against humans.

121,Fantasy,Heroes of Spira series by Dorian Hart,"The magical powers of Amazon algorithms recently brought me to The Ventifact Colossus, the first book in the Heroes of Spira series by Dorian Hart, which I’ve yet to see mentioned here on r/fantasy, despite the fact that the first three books have been out for a while now. 

It’s classic D&amp;D fantasy, in which a group of unlikely heroes are thrown together through the machinations of a mysterious archmage in order to save the world from an as yet imprisoned Dark Lord who is trying to break free. 

So, I actually really enjoyed the first two books (I’m going to start on the third tonight, number four is due to be released on April 30), despite going in without much in the way of expectations. I found I’ve really missed this kind of quest fantasy that’s fun without trying to be a comedy and that has its darker moments without being grimdark. The various party members are all well rounded, with and enjoyable to read about. The story alternates between their POVs and it’s fun to see what they think of each other, how they relate to the events of the story and I loved seeing how they grow from a group of strangers to a party that’s ready for the many challenges they have to face. 

Anyway, recommended!"

123,Fantasy,"When you want ""great characters"" what are you looking for?","I want a fantasy series with great characters, is an oft heard thing on r/fantasy. By reading these requests and the examples that go with them (both positive and negative) I've come to realize that people seem to mean a few different things by this statement, and I wanted to try articulating the different kinds of great character writing I've seen. (Obligatory of course there's overlap and not perfect as with all categorizations). 

To me the main things I've seen are great character *voice,* really well done character *arcs,* and fun distinct *personalities* (ok I don't think personality is the correct word here, but I'm struggling to put a name to this third category so going with this for now)*.*  Also for each of these examples, there is a key distinction between doing these well with main characters/pov characters and doing it well with all the other characters. Some more details with examples.

# Character Voice

This is when you immediately know the character from the words on the page. There's something distinctive and alluring that sucks you in, and this is intrinsically tied to the prose. 

Some Examples (used for illustration, lots of my favorite character voices are not listed)

* Joe Abercrombie: often talked about for his fantastic characters. You start a chapter and no one needs to tell you that you're reading Glokta, or Ninefingers, or Monza, you know just from the prose itself. The way these characters see the world, and talk, and are so clearly very distinct people is such a highlight of the series. **But** it was seeing this series so frequently talked about as a character series that made me realize I'd never originally thought of it that way, since I'd been thinking of character series as being about character *arcs.* And while these characters do arguably go through an arc, it's not really a highlight or strong suit of the series imo.  
* Tamsyn Muir. Gideon and Harrow the Ninth is another series I often see lauded for its characters, which again initially confused me. While I love Gideon/Harrow's voice (ok tbh mostly Harrow), I thought characters were a weakness of the books in that I couldn't keep track of any of the characters in Gideon outside of our protagonists and the main murderer, and Gideon's character arc just felt sudden and not well developed. Even Gideon's personality felt a bit bland to me (I like to hit things with my sword and joke around) so it's not what pops into my head when you say ""Great Characters."" **But** I totally get what people mean when they talk about how well developed and fun Gideon's voice is. And I most certainly loved the allure of reading from Harrow's pov, such a highlight!
* Shatter Me: This is a ya book that I recently read and felt super conflicted about the mc. On the one hand, I loved the way her voice is depicted. The trauma she'd gone through, the way she talks and thinks just shines and immediately drew me in. But my god, she's so so annoying and not proactive about anything, and her personality just super annoys me! It was a great example to me of the difference between enjoying a character's voice and enjoying a character's personality and was one of the inspirations for this post. 

# Character Arcs

I love a fantastic character arc. Watching characters grow and change in ways that feel so real. 

Examples (again, I apologize that listing all my favorites would require way too much space, and not add that much more to my point)

* Zuko from Avatar: I know I'm mostly talking about books, but it's hard to talk about amazing character arcs without mentioning Zuko, best &gt;!redemption!&lt; arc I've ever seen. But it took time, I felt he started out fairly boring.  Just a stereotypical one note villain. He did not have that immediate distinctive ""voice"" or personality. He grew into it, we were slowly shown his depth and how he changed, and we (or at least I) grew to love him. 
* Fitzchivalry Farseer: Watching Fitz grow from child to adult over three series/time periods was a phenomenal experience. This series also has good voice imo but not on the same level as the examples above (getting both does make this a highlight). But again, he wasn't someone who immediately make me think, wow the characterization and voice here is amazing. I fell in love with him more slowly as I felt his pain and watched him grow, or sometimes fail to grow. 
* Geder Palliako (Dagger and the Coin): He has one of my favorite character arcs and is one of the many highlights of Dagger and the Coin. At the same time, I'm very glad the whole series is not from his pov. I love reading his sections, but he's slimy enough I know I would not enjoy reading an entire epic fantasy series from his pov. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Character Personalities

These are the characters that are *fun* or *interesting* , that inspire me, make me love them, love to hate them etc. This one is super closely tied to both the other categories (great arcs usually require an interesting personality to be changed, and great voice makes that personality shine more strongly — but they aren't the same thing you can have one without the other.)

Examples (yup, again restricting myself to three examples means so many favorites get left out).

* Sanderson: yes, I know mentioning Sanderson brings out the controversy. But I was just so *confused* by all the posts I saw talking about how characters are a weakness of his and how bland and bad they are. These are the characters that inspire me to get up on my bad days, who make me stand up and cheer at their victories, and make me cry with their pain. I got to see a girl kick-ass by drawing unicorns! Some of these characters also have great character arcs (cough Dalinar, Shai, ) but mostly I just really love them. (ok, less so in some of his earlier books). But reading some of the (more articulated) criticisms, I realized that yes, the characters don't have that strong of voices or distinct speech patterns, and if that's what means a great character to you, I can understand why they might feel ""bland.""
* Royce and Hadrien (Riyria Revelations): Royce and Hadrien are *fun.* They have great banter, great interactions. I love watching them be badass, I feel for them when things go wrong. But I could totally understand if someone felt they were lacking, as I'd agree neither character has that much of a prose-voice. (though I think their dialogue-voice is excellent). And while they have character arcs that are enjoyable, they're nothing I'd rave about, or that are hugely central to the books. I'd say something similar for Legend of the First Empire series. 
* Gerald Tarant (Coldfire Trilogy) nails atmospheric villain all while playing a hero's role. Normally when I see villain protagonists (and Gerald isn't strictly the protagonists), they're more morally grey, or on redemptive tracks, or getting to know them as a protagonist some how leeches the atmospheric evil vibe from them (maybe a familiarity breeds contempt sort of thing?) not so with Gerald, who maintains himself as evil and powerful even when in a heroic role and I love him for it. Yes there is some arc, and yes some voice but he has this atmosphere when not in his perspective so I'll say it's not mostly a function of character voice nor is it really his arc that I'm particularly enjoying.

Does this resonate? What do you think of when you say ""great characters."" And yes, I somehow managed to write an entire character post without talking about Murderbot."
124,Fantasy,The Dragon Scribe Reviews and Fan Art: Mercurial by Naomi Hughes,"**The Review**

I received this book via NetGalley in return for an honest review. 

Mercurial follows the story of three POV protagonists: Tal, who once  believed he was on a mission from his god, is now imprisoned by an  unbreakable vow to protect a tyrant. Elodie, better known as The  Destroyer, the feared and terrible enforcer of an oppressive empire, and  the tyrant Tal is forced to protect. And Nyx, Tal’s half-sister and an  agent of the rebellion, who will do anything to see her brother free of  his oath. Following a failed assassination attempt on Nyx’s part, Elodie  finds herself stranded with Tal in a harsh wilderness, devoid of both  her memories and her powers. And then things get interesting.

Amnesia-as-redemption is both a thorny and interesting topic, and has  been deeply compelling in every medium I’ve seen it in. One of my  favorite video games handles this beautifully, but I won’t tell you  which one, because I hate to spoil one of the best plot twists of all  time, even twenty year later. Oof. I feel old. More recently, I read a  book with this trope that handled it cynically, with an amnesiac main  character determined to be a good person, and nevertheless descending  further into evil with every memory he regains. This book, however, is  not that one, and handles the issue with a refreshing amount of nuance.

At its heart, Mercurial is a novel about redemption and forgiveness.  How much is enough to atone for past sins? Are any atrocities bad enough  to make redemption impossible? The answer, as you may well guess, is  “It’s complicated,” and while Mercurial does not necessarily offer  concrete answers, it does treat the characters as humans with thoughts  and feelings and emotions who are capable of coming to conclusions of  their own.

My favorite part of this book was how human all of the characters  really were. Every single one of them made one or more terrible  decisions throughout the story, ones that made me shout “*Why*?”  and threaten to throw my e-reader out the window. But far from this  being a critique, it is actually testament to the author’s writing  kills. The author made me deeply care about the characters even as they  made me tear my hair out. There was a certain point in the story when I  was so frustrated with all the characters and their actions, that the  evil serial-murderer tyrant was actually my favorite. Many of the heroes  were driven by selfish motives, many of the villains had decent reasons  for doing what they did. And yet every single character was human, and I  found myself rooting for them even when I hated their guts, just a  little.

Without getting into any spoilers, I thought the way the book ended  was brilliant, and the way certain things came together, and various  actions bloomed into consequences good and bad, was really a sight to  behold. Mercurial was tightly plotted and well thought out, and  entertaining all the way through.

In terms of gripes (of course there are gripes), I think my biggest  complaint was I would have liked more. More of these characters, more of  this world. It was obvious everything was deeply developed with care,  but we simply don’t get to see enough of it. We know the current ruling  government is Bad, based on the fact that they’re apparently burning  down a village at the beginning of the novel because … reasons. But I’d  like to know more about why they’re bad, why they find it important to  burn random villages who might otherwise contribute to the country’s  GDP, and if the answer is “They’re just evil for funsies” that’s *fine,* I just wanted *more.*  The world in this novel is very intriguing, but I feel like we only see  just the barest surface of it. I would love to read anything else the  author decides to write in this world.

Mercurial is a great book for people who love redemption arcs, amnesia plots, and enemies to lovers romance.

**The Fan Art**

There were many vividly-described characters that would’ve been fun  to draw, but for this review, I chose to draw our villain-heroine  Elodie, the Destroyer. Another good thing about this book is the author  is great at physical descriptions. She gave me a lot to work with! I did  not reference the cover at all when drawing Elodie’s character, but  looking back at the cover, I think we both had a good idea of the  character based on the text!

125,Fantasy,Looking for Recommendations: Fantasy Featuring Grief/Trauma/Loss/Recovery,"After the end of Wandavision last Friday (rip my heart out, why don't you?), I'm in the mood for books where the main character processes serious grief, loss, and/or trauma through the arc of the book/series.

One of the great things about Wandavision was that this element wasn't the PRIMARY focus of the story, but slowly layered throughout in a way that made it incredibly easy to experience and relatable while still keeping the story entertaining.

So I want that in a fantasy book...

I want epic, dark, soul-crushing, noblebright, pretty much any kind of fantasy, with as much/little action and adventure included, but a subplot/theme of recovery from loss/processing trauma or grief. 

Hit me with those recs!

127,Fantasy,Para's Proper Reviews: The Tropic Of Serpents by Marie Brennan,"&gt; *…it does little good to cry, “I only wanted to study dragons!” Science is not separate from politics. As much as I would like it to be a pure thing, existing only in some intellectual realm unsullied by human struggle, it will always be entangled with the world we live in.*

Reviewing sequels is tricky business. Reviewing sequels years after you read the previous book is trickier. I read the first book before I started reviewing, and I knew I liked it enough to want to continue – but, well, it *has* been a while. While I fortunately had no issues remembering what happened before, I was very much not in the mood for it anymore. If not for the Bingo, I would not have persisted.

Isabella, now widowed, embarks on an expedition to the continent of Eriga, in hope to learn more about the tropical swamp-wyrm. The first part of the book, before she sets off, I enjoyed the least. And I know that the problem here is likely entirely me – I am sick to death of historical books set in England or fantasy-England. Especially the constant preoccupation with marriage as soon as you have female main characters. Though I did like how the issue of Isabella’s friend Natalie – who is aromantic and asexual and does not wish to be married – was resolved and that she was able to go on an adventure regardless.

I did not start enjoying myself until they entered the jungle and things finally started to get a bit more interesting, the pacing a little faster. I loved that despite having a protagonist from a colonizer country, it does address the issue of colonialism and interaction between the cultures, as much as it can with the framing. And I have always liked reading about culture clashes.

The finale is also excellent, but in the end, I can’t escape the fact that it was not the right book for me at the time. I struggled. Though I would like to continue the series, it’s unlikely to happen anytime soon.

128,Fantasy,One of my personal favourites!,"A four book(so far) fantasy series that I really enjoyed was The Ascendance Trilogy.  Book 1 is called **The False Prince.**  The plot is about a boy who is taken from an orphanage by a wicked nobleman named Conner , devises a cunning plan to find an impersonator of the king's long-lost son and install him as a puppet prince.

Sage (First person, male protagonist) has to compete against 3 other boys.  To prove how serious what he's doing is Conner makes a show of killing one of the boys.  Sage has to be picked or it means certain death.

This series contains many plot twists, cliffhangers and even romance as Sage falls in love with a ""mute"" servant girl.

**SPOILERS BELOW**

**Book 2:** Just weeks after Jaron has taken the throne, an assassination attempt forces him into a deadly situation. Rumors of a coming war are winding their way between the castle walls, and Jaron feels the pressure quietly mounting within Carthya. Soon, it becomes clear that deserting the kingdom may be his only hope of saving it. But the further Jaron is forced to run from his identity, the more he wonders if it is possible to go too far.

**Book 3:** War has come to his kingdom. It knocks at every door and window in the land. And when Jaron learns that King Vargan of Avenia has kidnapped Imogen in a plot to bring Carthya to its knees, Jaron knows it is up to him to embark on a daring rescue mission. But everything that can go wrong does.nHis friends are flung far and wide across Carthya and its neighbouring lands. In a last-ditch effort to stave off what looks to be a devastating loss for the kingdom, Jaron undertakes what may be his last journey to save everything and everyone he loves. But even with his lightning-quick wit, Jaron cannot forestall the terrible danger that descends on him and his country. Along the way he loses what matters most to him (so he thinks).

**Book 4:** In a peaceful Carthya, Jaron leads as the Ascendant King with Imogen beside him -- but the peace he fought so long for is not destined to last. On a routine sea voyage, Jaron's ship is brutally attacked, and he is taken hostage. The mysterious captors and their leader, Jane Strick, accuse Jaron of unthinkable acts. They are also in possession of some shocking items -- including the crown and sword that belonged to Jaron's older brother, Darius. The items unearth a past Jaron thought he had put behind him.

**Final Thoughts**

I personally really enjoyed this series and cannot wait for more installments, but to be frankly honest my favourite book was the first one.  The plot and the plot twists in that book were absolutely perfect.

Similar series I would recommend you try out is; Ranger's Apprentice, and The Belgariad(followed with The Malloreon).  If anyone has read these series and has some suggestions that are similar please let me know!"
129,Fantasy,Fantasy books with a tasteful romance?,"I've recently gotten back into reading books, and I've been itching specifically for a fantasy genre with some romance.
The fantasy type I'm looking for would be along the lines of Lord of The Rings, Dungeons and Dragons, or even Dragon Age. High fantasy!
I'd love something with a juicy romance to it, but a steady and strong story beyond just the romance.

I'm open to male or female leads, and it's a bonus if the relationships are LGBTQ+.
I'm also open to aspects of the MC falling for someone not typical, like an orc character or even a dragon that can polymorph, for a few examples.

Anyone have any ideas?

130,Fantasy,Is The Book of the New Sun complex in the Malazan style?,"Hi! I've felt tempted by the new Folio Society edition of the Book of the New Sun but I'm on the fence about purchasing it. I've read that it is a complex, hard to grasp book and I was wondering if its complexity is in the same style of Malaz. 

I've read until Memories of Ice and so far followed along quite well, with only minor points where I've felt confused. I think when you read Malaz you have a less steep curve if you are more less seasoned in fantasy and/or if you have done some role play. 

So, do you think the complexity of Wolfe's books is the same type of Erikson's?"
131,Fantasy,The Witcher is a Better introduction to Fantasy than Harry Potter(Let's See Why),"Yes, you read the title correct! I do believe The Witcher series is a better introduction to Fantasy as a genre than Harry Potter. I myself started with The Witcher ( even though I had read the first Harry Potter book at the time and yes like a billion other I too loved it!)
Lets see what is required from a good starting series in fantasy:-
1. A fast paced storyline so as to not bore the readers.
2. Social Commentary and Deep Themes explored at depth to interest someone who is into literary fiction and such other genre.( This in my opinion is the most important thing.)
3. A rich, deep world building which is easy to understand.
4. A not too lose nor too hard magic system.
5. A interesting and relatively short cast of Main Characters.(Each Character must also be fleshed out.)
6. Comedy which is not too cheesy but still present for the light hearted readers.
7. A mature/ well realised romance
8. Action and Violence
9. A badass Character.
10. A mature storyline so as to not isolate the mature audiance.

Now in my opinion Witcher has all of these. And more! Harry Potter has most of these too but.......ITS A MIDDLE GRADE BOOK! I know, I know,....now before you shoot me a thousand hateful comments, let me explain. I do believe that Harry Potter is an excellent start for kids but not so much for adults. Now I do think that Harry Potter can be read and enjoyed by adults too but the adults cannot relate to Harry Potter so much. Also if an adult picks up something like Game Of Thrones after reading Harry Porter seeing its wide popularity, they would be disappointed. Honestly Harry Potter is like LOTR. It's the best execution of the idea it presents. There are a lot of Harry Potter rip offs, just like there are many LOTR rip offs, the only one I can see coming close to Harry Porter is Percy Jackson. Harry Porter also represents a very small part of the fantasy genre. And then there is prose; even though I adore Rowling's prose, most high fantasy (and urban fantasy too) has more of a complex prose and world building which are very well present in the Witcher. The Witcher has a really flowery, well flowing , yet fast paced prose which is easy to read. I thus conclude but give me YOUR opinion on this matter. And comment down below if you know any better introduction to Fantasy! :)"

I was thinking of a cane, but thought that would be too similar to Kaz Brekker from Six of Crows. Is there anything else I could use instead? I was thinking of a mace or a baton but they aren’t as glamorous or cool.

# Half a Soul by Olivia Atwater

* **Genre:** Historical Fantasy, Fairy tale, Romance

* **Format:**  Ebook

&gt;*It’s difficult to find a husband in Regency England when you’re a young lady with only half a soul.*  
*Ever since a faerie cursed her, Theodora Ettings has had no sense of fear, embarrassment, or even happiness—a condition which makes her sadly prone to accidental scandal. Dora’s only goal for the London Season this year is to stay quiet and avoid upsetting her cousin’s chances at a husband… but when the Lord Sorcier of England learns of her condition, she finds herself drawn ever more deeply into the tumultuous concerns of magicians and faeries.*  
*Lord Elias Wilder is handsome, strange, and utterly uncouth—but gossip says that he regularly performs three impossible things before breakfast, and he is willing to help Dora restore her missing half. If Dora’s reputation can survive both her ongoing curse and her sudden connection with the least-liked man in all of high society, then she may yet reclaim her normal place in the world… but the longer Dora spends with Elias Wilder, the more she begins to suspect that one may indeed fall in love, even with only half a soul.*  
*Pride and Prejudice meets Howl’s Moving Castle in this enthralling historical fantasy romance, where the only thing more meddlesome than faeries is a marriage-minded mama. Pick up Half a Soul, and be stolen away into debut author Olivia Atwater’s charming, magical version of Regency England!*

This was a HEA bookclub read and it was delightful. Short, sweet, funny, charming, everything I look for in a Romance novel, I couldn’t put it down. The dynamic between the romantic leads is so fun and bantery, I couldn’t get enough of them. I loved the way only having half a soul affected Dora, she was still sweet but very emotionally detached from everything. And of course, what made her awkward in society made her a perfect match for the love interest, cause she wasn’t taking any of his bullshit. The book also featured faeries, which I always love. I liked how even though it’s a fluffy romance, it didn’t shy away from the harsh realities of the times, and how that was something that brought the main couple together. I was very happy with how the book tied up loose ends for the secondary characters too.

# Root Magic by Eden Royce

* **Genre:** Historical Fantasy
* **Age group:**  Middle Grade
* **Pub. date:** January 5th 2021
* **Format:**  Audiobook
* **Pages:** 352
* [Goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53175322-root-magic)

&gt;*A historical ghost story set in South Carolina in the 1960s—a tale of courage, friendship, and Black Girl Magic.*  
*It’s 1963, and things are changing for Jezebel Turner. Her beloved grandmother has just passed away. The local police deputy won’t stop harassing her family. With school integration arriving in South Carolina, Jez and her twin brother, Jay, are about to begin the school year with a bunch of new kids. But the biggest change comes when Jez and Jay turn eleven—and their uncle, Doc, tells them he’s going train them in rootwork.*  
*Jez and Jay have always been fascinated by the African American folk magic that has been the legacy of her family for generations—especially the curious potions and powders Doc and Gran would make for the people on their island. But Jez soon finds out that her family’s true power goes far beyond small charms and elixirs…and not a moment too soon. Because when evil both natural and supernatural comes to show itself in town, it’s going to take every bit of the magic she has inside her to see her through.*

First a note on the audiobook. When I started this, I loved the narrator Imani Parks so much that I immediately bought Amari and the Nightbrothers just to have more books read by her. (I had it on my TBR but not in the immediate section). I dunno how to describe voices though, I just loved it.

I read this for the Blackathon spirituality prompt and it turned out to be a great fit because it explored those themes a lot. My favorite parts were about Gullah culture and Root Magic. Jez is just now learning about Root, and I loved getting that knowledge, and also learning about the monsters and creatures she met. I’d gladly read more of that any day (yes give me recs pls)

It was pretty creepy for a children’s book, there are monsters, ghosts and dangers. Root Magic does not shy away from dealing with tough stuff. The story starts with the kid’s grandma dying and I couldn’t help but feel for them. There was also a sinister threat of violence from the beginning.

I thought the relationship between the twins Jez and Jay was very well done, the way they are growing up and growing apart in some ways, and how staying close is not always easy. We only get Jez’s perspective on things, and she was really going through a lot, and isolated at school, and that played into how her thoughts about her brother changed.

**Recommended for:** middle-grade fans, but also anyone looking for fantasy exploring some less-commonly-written-about magic cultures

# Midnight Blue-Light Special (InCryptid #2) by Seanan McGuire

* **Format:** Ebook
* **Pages:** 338
* [Goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13501633-midnight-blue-light-special)

&gt;*Cryptid, noun:*  
*1. Any creature whose existence has been suggested but not proven scientifically. Term officially coined by cryptozoologist John E. Wall in 1983.*  
*2. That thing that’s getting ready to eat your head.*  
*3. See also: “monster.”*  
*The Price family has spent generations studying the monsters of the world, working to protect them from humanity–and humanity from them. Enter Verity Price. Despite being trained from birth as a cryptozoologist, she’d rather dance a tango than tangle with a demon, and when her work with the cryptid community took her to Manhattan, she thought she would finally be free to pursue competition-level dance in earnest. It didn’t quite work out that way…*  
*But now, with the snake cult that was killing virgins all over Manhattan finally taken care of, Verity is ready to settle down for some serious ballroom dancing—until her on-again, off-again, semi-boyfriend Dominic De Luca, a member of the monster-hunting Covenant of St. George, informs her that the Covenant is on their way to assess the city’s readiness for a cryptid purge. With everything and everyone she loves on the line, there’s no way Verity can take that lying down.*  
*Alliances will be tested, allies will be questioned, lives will be lost, and the talking mice in Verity’s apartment will immortalize everything as holy writ–assuming there’s anyone left standing when all is said and done. It’s a midnight blue-light special, and the sale of the day is on betrayal, deceit…and carnage.*

After pandemic brain really got to me this month, I needed something easy to follow and fast to read. It delivered. They’re good popcorn reads for me, not that they lack substance, but that I can turn off my brain and enjoy the fun. Sometimes you just need one simple single PoV story with clear baddies, fashionable monsters, a supportive family and cute mice. And the Aesling are just great, love them. The Price family dynamic is, as always, lots of fun, and the little bits of wisdom from each chapter’s epigraph made me giggle.

Book 2 is a solid sequel, more getting to know the characters from book one, new dangers, rooftop chasing, some relationship developments, raising some stakes, good fun all around.

**Recommended for:** fans of urban fantasy looking for fun reads (and that have already read 1 book I guess, it wouldn’t be a good starting point)

&gt;*Din lutul amforelor de odinioara un mecanism extrage vocile si cantecele inregistrate ale atlantilor. Un vehicul submarin coboara la adancimi mari si e atacat de o creatura dintr-o specie necunoscuta. Planeta originilor, unde peisajele sunt cele mai frumoase din Univers, ramane destinatia ultima… Povestirile lui Ion Hobana ii ofera o multime de surprize placute cititorului de azi.*  
*„Am inteles ca totul fusese o inscenare. Exploratorul Timpului nu vedea din trecut, ci din viitor. Luase infatisarea eroului lui Wells pentru a stabili mai usor contactul cu o lume care s-a obisnuit sa vada implinindu-se anticipatiile din carti. Mi-ar fi destainuit probabil secretul, daca aventura mea nu l-ar fi avertizat ca trecutul poate deveni un labirint fara iesire.“*  
*Ion Hobana*

I didn’t end up finishing this, but I still wanted to talk about it for a little bit. For one thing, two of the short stories were published in international anthologies in the 80s, so that’s pretty nifty. And for another, the text had been updated in 2009 for a contemporary audience. So it was interesting to read stories initially written many years ago, including references to mobile phones and recently published books.

The reason I ended up not finishing was because I hadn’t realized it was a collection of short stories from the beginning, and I’m so rarely in the mood for them. I liked the first set of stories, called “a different kind of space” which was focused on underwater monsters and anomalies. I loved seas and oceans portrayed as alien spaces. I found those interesting and immersive. But then when the next set switched to actual outer space I would’ve wanted more underwater action and lost interest.

# The Lesson by Cadwell Turnbull

* **Genre:**  Near-future Sci-Fi

* **Format:** Ebook
* **Pages:** 286
* [Goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41459037-the-lesson)

&gt;*THE LESSON explores the nature of belief, the impact of colonialism, and asks how far are we willing to go for progress? Breaking ground as one of the first science fiction novels set in the Virgin Islands, THE LESSON is not only a thought-provoking literary work, delving deeply into allegorical themes of colonialism, but also vividly draws the community of Charlotte Amalie, wherefrom the author hails.*  
*An alien ship rests over Water Island. For five years the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands have lived with the Ynaa, a race of super-advanced aliens on a research mission they will not fully disclose. They are benevolent in many ways but meet any act of aggression with disproportional wrath. This has led to a strained relationship between the Ynaa and the local Virgin Islanders and a peace that cannot last. A year after the death of a young boy at the hands of an Ynaa, three families find themselves at the center of the inevitable conflict, witness and victim to events that will touch everyone and teach a terrible lesson.*

This wasn’t a great fit for me, because I think it’s got a more literary writing style than what pandemic brain could handle. It builds a picture by showing stories from multiple characters from the same family/social circle. Which made for an interesting picture that just didn’t click so well for me. Another thing was that I read it after a bunch of sci-fi books, and I was a little tired of the genre and aliens. It’s also, in some ways, more brutal than what I tend to read.

The book itself is interesting, and at a better time we would’ve probably gotten along. Seeing aliens arrive in a Caribbean Island setting was fun, whenever aliens arrive somewhere other than London/New York I’m all for it (the concept, not these specific assholes). And I thought the story made good use of the island setting. The aliens were human-looking but very scary, much of book is spent trying to puzzle out why they’re here and that was a good mystery. Though I wasn’t invested all the way along, I thought the plot paid off very well and liked everything about the ending, even the nasty parts. I thought it was really cool that the book opens with the alien ship in the sky, and then jumps forward 5 years. So we don’t see all the usual first contact stuff, just what happens after humans have, mostly, adjusted to having them here.

But Jez soon finds out that her family’s true power goes far beyond small charms and elixirs…and not a moment too soon. Because when evil both natural and supernatural comes to show itself in town, it’s going to take every bit of the magic she has inside her to see her through.*

First a note on the audiobook. When I started this, I loved the narrator Imani Parks so much that I immediately bought Amari and the Nightbrothers just to have more books read by her. (I had it on my TBR but not in the immediate section). I dunno how to describe voices though, I just loved it.

I read this for the Blackathon spirituality prompt and it turned out to be a great fit because it explored those themes a lot. My favorite parts were about Gullah culture and Root Magic. Jez is just now learning about Root, and I loved getting that knowledge, and also learning about the monsters and creatures she met. I’d gladly read more of that any day (yes give me recs pls)

It was pretty creepy for a children’s book, there are monsters, ghosts and dangers. Root Magic does not shy away from dealing with tough stuff. The story starts with the kid’s grandma dying and I couldn’t help but feel for them. There was also a sinister threat of violence from the beginning.

I thought the relationship between the twins Jez and Jay was very well done, the way they are growing up and growing apart in some ways, and how staying close is not always easy. We only get Jez’s perspective on things, and she was really going through a lot, and isolated at school, and that played into how her thoughts about her brother changed.

**Recommended for:** middle-grade fans, but also anyone looking for fantasy exploring some less-commonly-written-about magic cultures

## Midnight Blue-Light Special (InCryptid #2) by Seanan McGuire

* **Genre:** Urban Fantasy
* **Age group:** Adult
* **Pub. date:** March 5th 2013
* **Format:** Ebook
* **Pages:** 338
* [Goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13501633-midnight-blue-light-special)

&gt;*Cryptid, noun:*  
*1. Any creature whose existence has been suggested but not proven scientifically. Term officially coined by cryptozoologist John E. Wall in 1983.*  
*2. That thing that’s getting ready to eat your head.*  
*3. See also: “monster.”*  
*The Price family has spent generations studying the monsters of the world, working to protect them from humanity–and humanity from them. Enter Verity Price. Despite being trained from birth as a cryptozoologist, she’d rather dance a tango than tangle with a demon, and when her work with the cryptid community took her to Manhattan, she thought she would finally be free to pursue competition-level dance in earnest. It didn’t quite work out that way…*  
*But now, with the snake cult that was killing virgins all over Manhattan finally taken care of, Verity is ready to settle down for some serious ballroom dancing—until her on-again, off-again, semi-boyfriend Dominic De Luca, a member of the monster-hunting Covenant of St. George, informs her that the Covenant is on their way to assess the city’s readiness for a cryptid purge. With everything and everyone she loves on the line, there’s no way Verity can take that lying down.*  
*Alliances will be tested, allies will be questioned, lives will be lost, and the talking mice in Verity’s apartment will immortalize everything as holy writ–assuming there’s anyone left standing when all is said and done. It’s a midnight blue-light special, and the sale of the day is on betrayal, deceit…and carnage.*

After pandemic brain really got to me this month, I needed something easy to follow and fast to read. It delivered. They’re good popcorn reads for me, not that they lack substance, but that I can turn off my brain and enjoy the fun. Sometimes you just need one simple single PoV story with clear baddies, fashionable monsters, a supportive family and cute mice. And the Aesling are just great, love them. The Price family dynamic is, as always, lots of fun, and the little bits of wisdom from each chapter’s epigraph made me giggle.

Book 2 is a solid sequel, more getting to know the characters from book one, new dangers, rooftop chasing, some relationship developments, raising some stakes, good fun all around.

**Recommended for:** fans of urban fantasy looking for fun reads (and that have already read 1 book I guess, it wouldn’t be a good starting point)

## Un fel de spatiu by Ion Hobana

* **Genre:** Sci-Fi  Short Stories
* **Age group:** Adult
* **Pub. date:** June 26th 2015 by Nemira (first published January 1st 1982)
* **Format:** Print
* **Pages:** 200
* [Goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25754162-un-fel-de-spatiu)

&gt;*Din lutul amforelor de odinioara un mecanism extrage vocile si cantecele inregistrate ale atlantilor. Un vehicul submarin coboara la adancimi mari si e atacat de o creatura dintr-o specie necunoscuta. Planeta originilor, unde peisajele sunt cele mai frumoase din Univers, ramane destinatia ultima… Povestirile lui Ion Hobana ii ofera o multime de surprize placute cititorului de azi.*  
*„Am inteles ca totul fusese o inscenare. Exploratorul Timpului nu vedea din trecut, ci din viitor. Luase infatisarea eroului lui Wells pentru a stabili mai usor contactul cu o lume care s-a obisnuit sa vada implinindu-se anticipatiile din carti. Mi-ar fi destainuit probabil secretul, daca aventura mea nu l-ar fi avertizat ca trecutul poate deveni un labirint fara iesire.“*  
*Ion Hobana*

I didn’t end up finishing this, but I still wanted to talk about it for a little bit. For one thing, two of the short stories were published in international anthologies in the 80s, so that’s pretty nifty. And for another, the text had been updated in 2009 for a contemporary audience. So it was interesting to read stories initially written many years ago, including references to mobile phones and recently published books.

The reason I ended up not finishing was because I hadn’t realized it was a collection of short stories from the beginning, and I’m so rarely in the mood for them. I liked the first set of stories, called “a different kind of space” which was focused on underwater monsters and anomalies. I loved seas and oceans portrayed as alien spaces. I found those interesting and immersive. But then when the next set switched to actual outer space I would’ve wanted more underwater action and lost interest.

**Recommended for:** people who can read in Romanian are in interested in older sci fi short stories

## The Lesson by Cadwell Turnbull

* **Genre:**  Near-future Sci-Fi
* **Age group:** Adult
* **Pub. date: June 18th 2019**
* **Format:** Ebook
* **Pages:** 286
* [Goodreads link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41459037-the-lesson)

&gt;*THE LESSON explores the nature of belief, the impact of colonialism, and asks how far are we willing to go for progress? Breaking ground as one of the first science fiction novels set in the Virgin Islands, THE LESSON is not only a thought-provoking literary work, delving deeply into allegorical themes of colonialism, but also vividly draws the community of Charlotte Amalie, wherefrom the author hails.*  
*An alien ship rests over Water Island. For five years the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands have lived with the Ynaa, a race of super-advanced aliens on a research mission they will not fully disclose. They are benevolent in many ways but meet any act of aggression with disproportional wrath. This has led to a strained relationship between the Ynaa and the local Virgin Islanders and a peace that cannot last. A year after the death of a young boy at the hands of an Ynaa, three families find themselves at the center of the inevitable conflict, witness and victim to events that will touch everyone and teach a terrible lesson.*

This wasn’t a great fit for me, because I think it’s got a more literary writing style than what pandemic brain could handle. It builds a picture by showing stories from multiple characters from the same family/social circle. Which made for an interesting picture that just didn’t click so well for me. Another thing was that I read it after a bunch of sci-fi books, and I was a little tired of the genre and aliens. It’s also, in some ways, more brutal than what I tend to read.

The book itself is interesting, and at a better time we would’ve probably gotten along. Seeing aliens arrive in a Caribbean Island setting was fun, whenever aliens arrive somewhere other than London/New York I’m all for it (the concept, not these specific assholes). And I thought the story made good use of the island setting. The aliens were human-looking but very scary, much of book is spent trying to puzzle out why they’re here and that was a good mystery. Though I wasn’t invested all the way along, I thought the plot paid off very well and liked everything about the ending, even the nasty parts. I thought it was really cool that the book opens with the alien ship in the sky, and then jumps forward 5 years. So we don’t see all the usual first contact stuff, just what happens after humans have, mostly, adjusted to having them here.

141,Fantasy,Thoughts on Darker shade of Magic?,"*Disclaimer* I think the book is sound technically and I can see why people like it, but I just couldn’t get into it. 

The ending wasn’t worth it for me. I just thought it was too many endings for one book that was only like 400 pages. Everything ended smoothly. 

I’m not sure if she had the book contract secured for the trilogy but it felt like there was nothing to care about from book 1 to 2. 

The pacing was good for me, but at the end of the day I won’t pick up the rest of the series on my own."
142,Fantasy,"Okay guys, fantasy book question","Hey all, So I finished The First Law trilogy a few weeks ago and although I haven’t read the standalones nor the two books in The Age of Madness I am stepping away from Abercrombie’s work and saving the “best for last” so to speak. In the meantime I’ve narrowed a few things I’m interested in reading when it comes to a book because what I have read so far is solid but not as engaging as TFL. I felt like the characters were so fleshed out and unique that I was watching a movie! It was great, and I can’t seem to find a book that really grabs my attention. I’m going to list a few things I’m looking for in my next book and I HOPE I can narrow it down to maybe 3 because despite having posted some thing like this before I still feel lost because I was overwhelmed with so many suggestions.. and it’s not like I can rent the book. I have to purchase it and if I’m not interested in it by  50 pages I lose interest and therefore loose hard earned money .. guys this is what I need from a book 

Unique characters, “click, tap, pain” a character that is so specifically unique that he/she is jumping off the page and you feel as though you’re watching them (preferably more than one) 

Dark, brutal, realistic setting. I know some people don’t think that being dark is “realistic” but it’s pretty damn realistic in these kinds of worlds. Characters don’t get saved by the last minute, or win battles without coming out deformed and or disabled 

Shocking twist and turns, chapters that may even make you want to put the book down out of the pure shock of what just happened 

Characters that die.  I don’t know what that says about me but yes, as bittersweet as it is POV characters that suddenly die without any build up REALLY gets me hooked. After reading Ned’s death and “the red wedding” chapter it hooked me that much more because I knew at that point the series was like no other

Deconstructions of characters

Uncliche situations, as soon as you think you know what’s about to happen the author jerks you another way 

TRAGIC ARCS and/or backstories, boy do I love a good tragedy .. it gives me something to think about 

I want to feel deep in my thoughts after reading whichever book I pick up next"
143,Fantasy,Books with Orcs (or Goblins) as the protagonist?,"Let's be real with each other. Orcs are by far and away, the coolest of the fantasy races. Their armor and weaponry is often jagged, brutal, and effective. They're often physically stronger and other races often view them with fear, disdain, or both. But despite how cool they are, they're often just depicted as either minions for the primary antagonist or a more side race in comparison to Humans, Elves, or even Dwarves (though I really like Dwarves).

Well I want an Orcish protagonist. They're my favorite race in the Elder Scrolls, and I play Shadow of Mordor/War exclusively to get the coolest most badass orcs. The few books I've read that have them relegate then to the sidelines or as a faceless horde. So give me your best books with an Orc as the primary protagonist or as a major side character at least. I will also settle for Goblins or Ogres.

Thanks friends."
144,Fantasy,Deep / Philosophical fantasy series about finding yourself?,"I have been reading some Sanderson and Jemison and I see a lot of real world influences from events like wars, class, race, culture, politics reflective of western classics, even in something like Dune with its middle eastern flair is very...western. I wonder If there are just as in depth stories exploring nomads, refugees or outcasts. finding purpose and identity beyond.  


I am a refugee of sorts and dont relate with my birthplace (political discrimination), My parents ethnic origin (cant relate) or even where I live now (too new). I am a bit lost as to my place in the world. I've siphoned much wisdom from these fantasy worlds and I wonder If something about self discovery might help me build context and confidence :)

But anyways on to wild speculation of next years even though we have a few weeks to go before it gets revealed.

Some squares I thought of - 

* Author's Abroad - Author not from your home country. Hard - from another continent
* Horror - categories include Gothic, Lovecraftian, etc - Hard Not Lovecraft (or something similar)
* Out of this world - SF/F that takes place not on earth. Hard - Must be a real planet
* Portal Fantasy
* Classical remembrence - Read a SF/F classic (examples LotR, Wizards of Earthsea, etc) Hard - Participate in current keeping up with the classics botm
* Knife in the Dark - Book featuring assassins - Hard - the assassin is the main character"

Obviously you guys don’t list who specifically died but rather you could just list a book where it has that sudden shock of death with its POV or really important characters that almost come out of no where and hooks you in even more in the book.

156,Fantasy,Reviewing everything I've read in February part II,"As I said before. One of my goals for this year was to review every book I read. I did January and the first half of the February ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ljmarz/minirveiew_of_what_ive_read_in_february_so_far/)) and here I am few days late because life to review the rest of the month. 

I've also read less because, yes, life. But this year continues to be maybe the best reading year so High rates across the borad yet again. 

**Harrow the Ninth (reread) by Tamsyn Muir (audiobook) -** after enjoying the hell out of my Gideon reread I decided to not wait for march to do HtN as well. As was the case with Gideon, the reread was MUCH better then the first time. It is now probably in my top 5 series of all time and AtN is one of my most antipated books ever. 5/5. Moira Quirk is phenomenal here as well. 

**A Natural History of Dragons by Marrie Brennan (audiobook)** \- I heard about Lady Trent here a lot and wasnt sure it was for me but after listening to The Mask of Mirrors I decided to check more of the authors work and I LOVED IT. The character was so funny and relatable (and Im a male and dont live in a victorian era) The dragons were cool and the twists and turns were suprising (also I always felt the tension and thats hard to do in the prequelish storytelling style). Oh yeah and the dragons were super cool. Can't wait to continue. 4.5/5. Kate Reading does the narration. Do I need to say more?

**Sourcery by Terry Pratchett (audiobook)** \- I havent read a DW book in a while and decided to check in with Rincewind and the Luggage that I havent read from in  a while. It was great. I shouldn't have taked such a big break from the discworld and I'll try to avoid that in the future. Finished this book in one day and enjoyed it a lot. 4/5. Nigel Planer narrated this and his delivery is just as british as you would expect  (in a good way lol). 

**The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson (Ebook)** \- I was warned before the first page that this will hurt both by the book itself and by people here talking about this one. I thought I was ready but boy I was not. The questin of why I was doing it to myself came up and I really can'y explain but the fact is that I will probably recommend this book to people in the fiuture so maybe I was the traitor all along? great book, will continue. But I need some time to recover first lol. 4.5/5

**The Empress of Salt and Fortune by Nghi Vo (Ebook)** \- I heard a lot about this one but didn't really know anything about it so I was pleasantly suprised by this great asian inspired world and by the short stories that make a longer one together format. It's a beautiful novela that you can read in one sitting and I highly recommend both that and the sequel (that I finished in March so will not review today). 5/5. 

**The Bone Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart (audiobook)** \- So I had this book in my kindle for a while and then it was the daily deal at audible and I couldnt resist. I came to this knowing nothing (aside from the existence of a talking pet) and was again blown away by how good this was. Really hard to believe this was a debut. Lin's was my favourite storyline tho I cant wait for the next book to see where Sand's takes her. 5/5 (and it's a debut? wow). The narration was awesome. I love it every time there are several narrator and every pov chracter gets one and this did not disappoint.

**To Be Taught if Fortunate by Becky Chambers (Ebook)** \- I dont know why it took me so long to try a Becky Chambers book but after Baru I wanted a really opsimistic read and decided this novella will do great. And it delivered. I wasn't expecting that this will make me cry more then Baru did but well... what a beautiful little story. I can't think of one bad thing to say about this one and the Wayfarers is coming up soon because I need more. 5/5. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since were allready a week into march I can tell you that I have read/listened to 2 more novellas (When the Tiger Came Down the Mountain by Nghi Vo and The Original by Mary Robinette Kowal and Sanderson) and Im currently listening to the new ""A Desollation Called Peace"" which is so far even better then the first one maybe? and I also started Dragon Mage by ML Spencer and loving it but Im really in the beginng as there was a lot of stuff happening in life lately."
157,Fantasy,My review of… a theft of swords. A book for a bad day.,"My previous review was for [A memory called empire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ll0vwj/my_review_of_a_memory_called_empire_whats_not_to/). 

That book was trying to be fresh and new. This book feels like old familiar ground and I loved it. An Indiana Jones movie of a book, well worn tropes well executed. It won’t test you and you’ll enjoy it.



**Summary**

Our heroes are two expert thieves who are hired to steal a sword. Unfortunately politics get’s involved and they find themselves on the run with the heir to a Kingdom and a weight of responsibility.

The world is a classic fantasy land analogous of 16th century Europe. Magic has existed but is now mostly forgotten instead we’ve got Kings and a powerful church all vying for power.



**What I expected (and what I got)**

Something like Dragonlance. Old fashioned sword and sorcery. Elves and dwarfs and good people and bad people. 

High stakes, fast plot along with friends making amiable bitchy jokes at each other and the occasional character who is mostly there for comic relief.

The books started off as self published and there is a joyous clunkiness to them. The dialogue in a theft of swords, sometimes feels like you’re listening to modern day folks. Quite regularly the author will put in 3 pages of outright exposition. The characters do have some depth to them, not a lot, but they are not cardboard cut outs either.

Any book about thieves has to be compared to the Gentleman bastards series. It is no where near as refined as those, the author is not as good, but The Lies of Locke Lamora really is top tier and that should not put you off.

It does feel like an old book, LGBT* representation is a bit low. I’m not someone who needs it, but a passing reference to the fact someone has two dads or something like that, is always nice.



**You should read if you liked**

Dragonlance, Lies of Locke Lamora, Cradle


I would give this book a solid 9/10 I think its the most fun I've had in a book for a while."

I want magic, betrayal, swords, maybe even dragons or orcs you know those kind of adventures. I like the who coup or Usurper stories where someone has to first run for their life then rebuild and come back for their crown. Or the ones where a heir is born and hidden or maybe our of wedlock and someone has to track them down because they are the last true heir left. I'd prefer a gay/bi male character but gen is fine.

Nothing against m/f relationships, I'm just over and done with wayward prince meeting a strong stubborn (powerful, lost, independent) woman falling in love and ruling together, it feels like fair to many books have that plot.

Stories like Sam Burn's Fire and Valor, Prince's Assassin Book by Ariana Nash, or *Codex* Alera series by Jim Butcher."
163,Fantasy,I’m 200 pages from the end of Clive Barker’s “Imajica” and an overwhelming sadness hit me for the reason that it’ll be over.,"Let me start by saying this: I NEVER read fantasy. I’ve always been envious of avid fans of the genre. They’re ability to lose themselves in the worlds that the authors are able to create is something I’ve always admired. But I’ve never been able lose myself like them (you beautiful folks). 

My genre has always been horror. For as long as I can remember, the books and movies that have stuck with me the most have been within horror. I began with an assigned reading of “The Lottery” by Shirley Jackson in high school and her writing struck something. So, I delved deeper and read “The Haunting of Hill House“. I’ve scourged over horror authors ever since. Stephen King (of course), Brian Evenson, Paul Tremblay, Kathe Koja, Alma Katsu, Stephen Graham Jones, Junji Ito, Laird Barron, John Langan, etc.

Then I decided to delve deeper. Into the classics. Ambrose Bierce, Bram Stoker, R.W. Chambers, Algernon Blackwood, Edgar Allan Motherfucking Poe, and my absolute favorite...

H.P. Lovecraft. “The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest  
and strongest fear is fear of the unknown”

These later authors wrote about the cryptic. The mysterious. The weird. Thus birthed my love of cosmic horror. It was so wild and imaginative. It took me somewhere else. I relinquished all belief and let the writing take me. And then I thought to myself, “this is what fantasy does.” 

So, I split hairs in between the genres, and picked up Clive Barker’s epic “Imajica”. His prose is downright poetically macabre. Imaginatively and indecently beatific. And I cannot get enough. I’m currently 200 pages from the end, and I just find myself so sad that I won’t be able to follow these characters on their journey anymore. While reading, I find myself saying things out loud, as if I’m talking to the story. “Wait, he was over in this world earlier.” “Hang on, she doesn’t know this about her.” Etc. I’m so emotionally attached to this story. The poetic prose, the intricately developed characters, the wildly imaginative plot, I’m so sad. 

Help me recover from this. By recommending me something similar. I’ve heard Brandon Sanderson is exceptional. I have zero desire for George R R Martin.  Neil Gaiman is a familiar.

168,Fantasy,The Witcher series by Andrzej Sapkowski - A Review,"Warning: SPOILERS WILL NOT BE TAGGED so the first couple paragraphs are just background on how I read the books to avoid anyone scrolling accidentally seeing spoilers

I began reading the Witcher series after watching the Netflix adaptation. I’ve never played the games (but have heard great things; The Witcher 3 is waiting to be played on my Steam account). Boy, I was not prepared at all for the richness and depth of this series!

I started out with the collections of short stories. I finished *The Last Wish* feeling like I didn’t want to keep reading. I loved the story and the world, but the writing seemed so empty. As it turned out, it wasn’t the writing - it was the translation! I re-read *The Last Wish*, but this time read the fan translation. It blew my mind how much better it was. Then I read *The Sword of Destiny* and loved it. Next on the docket was *A Season of Storms*, which I ended up not finishing. I wanted to get to the main story!

Happily, there was a different translator for the novels than for the short story collections. I decided to read the fan translation of *Blood of Elves*, then the official translation for *Time of Contempt,* then back to fan translation for *Baptism of Fire*. After that I kept to the official translations.

**Things I didn't like**  
Things I didn’t like mostly related to how the story was framed. I don’t when books use the structure of relaying events by having one character tell other characters what happened when those events take longer than one or two pages to tell, or when you’re taken “back in time” through that conversation. I don’t feel it adds anything positive to the story and I get disoriented trying to keep track of if I’m in the present or past when it changes every few pages. Reading on an e-reader exacerbates this since it’s more difficult to go back and check a detail. I also don’t like frequent POV changes during a single chapter, especially when the POV change isn’t explicitly clear about which character it is within the first five words. However, I am super jazzed to watch those sequences (especially the Ciri and Kenna describing Ciri's escape from Bonhart) in the Netflix adaptation. I like how that works in film/television, but not so much in print.

It was kind of weird to me that the world was pretty primitive technologically but really advanced in biological/genetic understanding. Part of the reason I didn’t finish *A Season of Storms* was the discussion of the genera and species of certain monsters. “Latin” binomials and taxonomy are relatively new, but we’re often told the story takes place in the 13th century. It took me out of the story too much.


**Things that Confused Me**    
Why did Ciri’s hair have streaks of white in it in *The Lady of the Lake* and why did it upset Geralt so much?

Why was there a digression in *Tower of the Swallow* (I think) that seemed to depict Dandelion’s tube of notes being destroyed? We know the writings survived because they’re quoted at the beginning of several chapters, as well as being mentioned in the story.

Why is “Witcher” capitalized for Geralt, but Ciri is always “witcher” or “witcher girl” with a lower-case w?

Thank you to anyone who can shed some light on these!

**Things I LOVED**    
Yennefer. What a brilliant character. I absolutely hated her in the early books - her selfishness and short temper made her so abrasive. By the end of the series, though, I would have killed for her. What a queen. Her fierce love for Geralt and Ciri made her such a realistic and relatable character. Just like with real people, love can smooth over our faults.

Geralt is also an incredible character. For a series called The Witcher to have the titular witcher disillusioned with being a witcher and then lose his elixirs and swords halfway through the story is brilliant. To also have him die at the end was perfect and cruel. The last chapter broke my heart.

Cahir’s story is so sad that it made me angry. The guy betrays his country because he falls in love with Ciri, teams up with Geralt to help find her, and dies immediately after finding her. He is brave and good, and dies alone. Does Sapkowski just enjoy making his readers cry????

As I mentioned earlier, I was completely unprepared for the depth of this series. The richness of the world, the diversity in characters, the complexity of politics and social issues, and the creative inclusion of fairy tales and myths resulted in a book series unlike anything else. I can't wait to see it brought to life on screen - I absolutely adore Henry Cavill as Geralt and am excited to see his portrayal. What did you all enjoy or not enjoy about this series?"

Also I’d love to see a story from the POV of a magic wall, incredibly random yes I know but its just something I’ve become interested in after seeing the Dyer Wall in Green Rider along with a single page written from a walls POV that got posted in a discord I’m in.

172,Fantasy,Another Bingo mini-review thread,"This was a weird year for me. From getting lost in the world of Raymond StElmos Quest of Five Clans and finding myself a month behind, to relapsing into my crippling Factorio addiction, to busting the addiction but still retaining the slump, I found myself in 2021 and actually moderately stressed about making bingo. Thankfully, I finished the card on some very readable books (Night Watch, Radiance, Jade City, The Girl and the Stars, and Mid-Lich Crisis) that had me motivated and now here I am, nearly a month left and all done! So what to read before the next card? Taking all suggestions...

Regarding ratings, I rate as follows:

1 star and 2 stars - I don't do it. I just don't talk about them3 stars - Wasn't for me, but would recommend if the person was looking for something that fit4 stars - Will recommend if there is a close-ish match.5 stars - Loved it, will recommend to anyone who I think might listen

Basically, I'm a positive reader. I gladly ignore flaws and find the good in things, and when I say ""wasn't for me"" that is often a timing issue - it wasn't for me now, but in another time, I would have enjoyed it.

I've also linked some of my goodreads reviews. My reviews there are more ""inspired by"" than actual reviews, and I just try to have fun with them. If you only read one of them, make it the one for Uprooted as I'm particularly proud of that one, and it's a true story to boot.

So, without further ado...

*Novel Translated from its Original Language* (not hard mode): **The Night Watch** (Sergei Lukyanenko). 5 stars. Urban Fantasy set in Russia, it follows a ""good"" wizard, part of the Night Watch who is tasked with upholding the treaty with the ""bad"" wizards by hunting down rogues. Really a series of chronological novellas, this was really, really enjoyable - well paced, thoughtful, and maybe it's my lack of urban fantasy experience showing through but it was quite unique. Heartily recommended. And I share a name with the bad guy!

*Setting Featuring Snow, Ice or Cold* (hard mode): **The Left Hand of Darkness** (Ursula K LeGuin). 5 stars. Another Bingo square, another ""how did I get to this age without reading this author"" embarassment. A story of a galactic empire ambassador tasked with convincing a semi-alien race into joining the empire. The aliens are human except for the fact they are androgynous and change to a specific sex once a month for breeding. There were a couple of sections around the start that were a tad plodding, but then there were sections of pure brilliance. The suicide vignette was beautiful, and the trek across the ice was perfection. Everyone should read this.

*Optimistic SFF* (hard mode): **The Utterly Uninteresting and Unadventurous Tales of Fred the Vampire Accountant** (Drew Hayes). 4 stars. Follows an accountant who has recently been turned into a vampire as he comes to terms with his affliction and makes a bunch of new friends. I expected this to be more humerous, and while it did have humour for my tastes it either fell flat or just generated a smile. Having said that, it fit ""optimistic"" perfectly and was enjoyable even if not rioutously funny. It's better than I make it sound here, btw, so don't be turned off that I'm not gushing!

*Novel Featuring Necromancy* (not hard mode): **The Library at Mount Char** (Scott Hawkins). 5 stars. No, 4 stars. Maybe 3. I dunno!! A group of people have been raised by a ""father"" god (of sorts) and trained each into different skills - necromancy, warfare/combat, talking to animals, languages, etc. And now their ""father"" is missing. I wrote a thread on this one with my thoughts… [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/i2n1xp/the\_library\_at\_mount\_char\_discussionrant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/i2n1xp/the_library_at_mount_char_discussionrant/). Tl;dr; It was great at the start (really, really great) but I found the ending to be too much telling and not enough showing.

*ACE/ARO Spec Fic* (hard mode): **Sufficiently Advanced Magic** (Andrew Rowe). 5 stars. Teen/young adult goes into magical tower to try and find his missing brother, passes test and joins magic school. Really enjoyable, with a good mix of questing and school. It gets a lot of love here and I totally get why. I've read book two now also and will be checking out others soon. Solid entertainment. My review of book 2 (it's a riff on the genre...): [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3348626639](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3348626639)

*Novel Featuring a Ghost* (hard mode?): **The Only Good Indians** (Stephen Graham Jones). 5 stars. I haven't read much horror. That may change. This was fantastic. Very intense, atmospheric. Also very dark. Not for people who are sensitive to violence towards pets/animals. 3 young men on a hunting trip encounter a group of elk unable to escape. Blood lust ensues. And after the hunt, revenge.

*Novel Featuring Exploration* (hard mode): **Iron Council** (China Mieville). 3 stars. A workers revolution occurs and the revolutionaries take off on a train, laying track in front of them and removing it from behind them. I've been a fan of Mievilles Bas Lag work so far so had high hopes for this. And as a hard core lefty, the subject matter was right up my alley. But this fell flat. Really flat.

*Climate Fiction* (not hard mode): **The Road** (Cormac McCarthy). 5 stars. Father and son in post-apocalyptic world are following a road south looking for more habitable climate. I knew this was going to be hard (emotionally) and had been putting it off. McCarthy is one of my favourite authors and this just reinforced that. I'm not ashamed that I had to put it down a few times because the pages were too blurry. A brilliant book that I will likely never read again.

*Novel with a Colour in the Title* (hard mode): **Redemption in Indigo** (Karen Lord). 3 stars. Wife of glutton comes into possession of a magic stick that lets her control chaos. There were bits I liked and bits that bored me and bits that just didn't seem to fit. The idea was good, some of the execution was good, but overall… Just OK.

*Book Club* (not hard mode): **Mid-Lich Crisis** (Steve Thomas). 4 stars. From Resident Authors Book Club. 4 stars. A (don't say the e-word) wizard has been terrorising his subjects for years, and is not only slain by his warrior nemesis but his phylactory, the key to his immortality, is broken and sent to the ends of the earth. Years later it is recovered by his favourite minion, and he seeks to rehabilitate his name and prevent Armageddon. This was fun! Really well paced and clever. Well worth a look.

*Self-published SFF novel* (hard mode, at the time...): **The Scaled Tartan** (Raymond St Elmo). 5 stars. My love for StElmo knows no bounds, and is well documented. Read him. My reviews of his work:The Moon Tartan: [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2899200656](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2899200656)The Harlequin Tartan: [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3211507770](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3211507770)The Clockwork Tartan: [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3308153166](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3308153166)The Scaled Tartan: [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3308155788](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3308155788)

*Novel with Chapter Epigraphs* (hard mode): **Beyond Redemption** (Michael R Fletcher). 4.5 stars. I had been intrigued by this based on how it's considered as grimdarky as grimdark gets, and the concept of belief shaping reality making the craziest people the most powerful sounds interesting. That this is considered the same sub-genre as Abercrombe is a bit absurd as this WAS relentlessly bleak a violent and I just don't get that from Joe... I think it would have been better dialling the ""grimdark"" down a notch and expanding the characters a little more, but it was still a good read, even a great read. The ideas were very cool and interesting, and the execution was strong. Another poster here said the authors other books have better character work so I'll check them out at some point. Some books diminish with memory but this has not.

*Novel Published in 2020* (not hard mode): **A Girl and the Stars** (Mark Lawrence). 4 stars. Lawrence is one of my favourites, and it's his variety that puts him there. This is the story of a girl who throws her self down a hole to save her brother, sacrificed for being gifted. Down there she discovers a hidden world. There was a bit too much of the main character digging a little deeper and finding more power, and I felt a lot of the characters to be interchangeable. Having said that, the focus of this book didn't appear to be the characters, it was the action, and the action was great.

*Novel Set in School or University* (hard mode). **Ninth House** (Leigh Burdago). 4 stars. Set in Yale, there are 8 houses of magic and the ninth house is the one that polices them. There was not much focus on schooling, with most of it being how she needed to focus on school at some point, and most is a murder mystery. I'm torn on this. Reading it I enjoyed it, but as time passes I'm less and less enamoured with it.

*Book about Books* (hard mode): \*\*A Magical Inheritance (\*\*Krista D Ball). 5 stars. Was curious going into this one as to how it would be interesting (a book about someone sorting books?), and I had a feeling that my grimdark loving self was not the target audience, but it had positive praise so I gave it a go and… beyond the first few pages where the protagonist spent most the time crying it was actually really enjoyable and not slow and plodding at all. Indeed, the last 30% was read in one overly long sitting. I wasn't surprised that this was good, as plenty of people whose opinions I respect on the matter said it was, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it!

*A Book that Made You Laugh* (hard mode): **Lamb** (Christopher Moore). 5 stars. Follows the story of Jesus in the missing years between when he was born and when he's picked up in the gospels. And his best friend, Biff. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The idea of Jesus training to be a Tibetan monk, kung fu master and other absurdities sounds a bit too silly, but it was actually done well and wasn't cringe at all. And yes, it made me laugh. I'll be checking out more of his stuff for sure. It was very, very funny, and considering the subject matter was very well done indeed. It was also very touching at times. I was totally surprised by this - I went in thinking I'd enjoy it, but it was better than I could have hoped and Moore deserves some more love around here.

*Five SFF Short Stories* (hard mode): **The Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, Volume Thirteen** (Jonathon Strahan). Mixed stars... Like all collections it was a mixed bag - some brilliant (the opener, and the one by NK Jemisin come to mind) some promising but not quite hitting the mark (the elephant story) and some forgettable (i.e. can't recall them). I think short stories aren't my bag except in small doses, so next time around I might space this square out over the course of the year instead of doing cover to cover. I find myself just getting absorbed and then it's over. Like the elephant story - I spent most of it trying to get a handle, had just got a handle and started to think ""yeah, this is interesting!"" and then it's over.

*Big Dumb Object* (not hard mode): **Uprooted** (Naomi Novik). 5 stars. Every 10 years a young girl is taken from the village that lies next to a cursed forest and given to The Dragon, a powerful wizard. The start had me worried - the protagonist was very teen and I didn't like her at all. But she grew, and as she grew so did my like of her. This was a great book, deserving of the rewards and love it gets here. I'll just add that it was far darker than it's given credit for. Everyone talks about the fairytale feel to it, but it's a dark fairytale not a disney one. My review, please read it, I'm proud (and it's a true story): [https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3375645868](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3375645868)

*Feminist Novel* (hard mode): **The Parable of the Talents** (Octavia Butler). 5 stars. Follow up to her brilliant Parable of the Sower, this follows Lauren as she tries to establish her settlement and religion, and her daughter as she seeks to find her mother. If the first book was dark, this is that carbon nano-paint, but through the atrocity there is also more hope than the first book. Butler was a prophet.

*Novel by a Canadian Author* (hard mode): **The Hammer of the Gods: So You Want to be a Star** (Andrew Marc Rowe). 3 stars. This one was read in the very depths of my Factorio relapse, and based on my understanding of the author (I'm a consumer of his podcast, The Sunday Night Dragon Show, check it out) I'm sure he'll understand that my heart wasn't in this. I *will* say though that if you're not into crass humour, you'll want to avoid this. If you do like crass humour though, it has this in spades.

*Novel with a Number in the Title* (not hard mode): **16 Ways to Defend a Walled City** (KJ Parker). 4 stars. A man living in an empire has been promoted due to his competence and in spite of his outsider skin colour. And now the empire is under attack and he's found himself in charge. There was lots to like in this, but by the end I was a tad disappointed. It started strong, and kept on at a good pace, but the ending fell totally flat for me, which is disappointing. Sections of brilliance let down by sections of mediocrity finishing with a book that I'll totally recommend when it fits what someone is looking for but I won't be gushing about at every opportunity

*Romantic Fantasy/Paranormal Romance* (not hard mode): **Radiance** (Grace Draven). 4 stars. I was NOT looking forward to this square, but my fears of swooning women and dashingly handsome but brooding men were thankfully quashed as soon as our lovers first met. Well paced, and with a humour and romance that felt natural, this took me by surprise. And the ending meant I will be picking up book 2.

*Novel with a Magical Pet* (Hard mode): **Lirael** (Garth Nix). 4 stars. Sabriel, the opening book to the series, was pretty much a standalone and quite enjoyable. This one, alas, finishes halfway through the story, meaning I have to pick up book 3 to find out what happens. I don't have an issue with that! I'm not the target audience for this one, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. And given it has not one but TWO magical talking pets, I think I deserve extra credit.

*Graphic Novel* (hard mode): **Watchmen** (Alan Moore/Dave Gibbons). 5 stars. What can be said about this that hasn't already been said? It's a classic. Arguably THE classic. And with reason. Wow.

*Novel Featuring Politics* (hard mode): **Jade City** (Fonda Lee). 5 stars. Magical kung fu gangsters, a turf war and a power vaccuum. I was worried the politics novel would be a bit plodding, as with a few exceptions the politics sections of my fantasy novels usually bore me a little. This was not boring. It was great. Check it out."

Hard Mode

Other Bingo Squares: Exploration, Politics, Feminist

3/5 Stars

&gt;Set in 1491 during the reign of the last sultanate in the Iberian peninsula, *The Bird King* is the story of Fatima, the only remaining Circassian concubine to the sultan, and her dearest friend Hassan, the palace mapmaker.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hassan has a secret--he can draw maps of places he's never seen and bend the shape of reality. When representatives of the newly formed Spanish monarchy arrive to negotiate the sultan's surrender, Fatima befriends one of the women, not realizing that she will see Hassan's gift as sorcery and a threat to Christian Spanish rule. With their freedoms at stake, what will Fatima risk to save Hassan and escape the palace walls?  
&gt;  
&gt;As Fatima and Hassan traverse Spain with the help of a clever jinn to find safety, *The Bird King* asks us to consider what love is and the price of freedom at a time when the West and the Muslim world were not yet separate.

First things first, do not listen to the audiobook. The audiobook is one of the worst audiobooks I have ever listened to. The narrator herself is decent, not wholly bad, but the production is so weird. It's like they are piecing together a lot of different recordings but never edited out any gaps. So there are a bunch of weird pauses in the middle of sentences, and that was at 1.6 speed (and I usually stick to 1.3).

Anyways the book itself. It very much reads like a literary fiction book - a little meandering, very personal, a slow build. It's well written and I enjoyed the story, but it definitly wasn't my favorite. The most interesting part was towards the end and I wish we got more than an hour (our of a 15 hour book) dedicated to that part. Satisfying and optimistic end, but I wish the first half was done in like 1/4 of the book and the last bit was a bigger chunk.

[To Be Taught, If Fortunate by Becky Chambers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43190272-to-be-taught-if-fortunate)

Other Bingo Squares: Asexual, Book Featuring Exploration

4.5/5 Stars

&gt;In her new novella, Sunday Times best-selling author Becky Chambers imagines a future in which, instead of terraforming planets to sustain human life, explorers of the solar system instead transform themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ariadne is one such explorer. As an astronaut on an extrasolar research vessel, she and her fellow crewmates sleep between worlds and wake up each time with different features. Her experience is one of fluid body and stable mind and of a unique perspective on the passage of time. Back on Earth, society changes dramatically from decade to decade, as it always does.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ariadne may awaken to find that support for space exploration back home has waned, or that her country of birth no longer exists, or that a cult has arisen around their cosmic findings, only to dissolve once more by the next waking. But the moods of Earth have little bearing on their mission: to explore, to study, and to send their learnings home.  
&gt;  
&gt;Carrying all the trademarks of her other beloved works, including brilliant writing, fantastic world-building and exceptional, diverse characters, Becky's first audiobook outside of the Wayfarers series is sure to capture the imagination of listeners all over the world.

I love Becky Chambers. Everything she writes makes me feel so hopeful and happy and sometimes a little sad. This book felt like the perfect quarantine read. Four people are stuck with each other, under rules and regulations that make things hard at times. They can't see their family and &gt;!at a certain point they feel incredibly hopeless.!&lt; This wasn't really a bright and cheerful book, but melancholy and hopeful. There was a segment that &gt;!felt like a horror book.!&lt; I really can't recommend it enough, especially now. The world itself feels so perfect. It's ours, but without the politics and the pandemic, with a well funded science and space department.

[The Extraordinaries by T. J. Klune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52380340-the-extraordinaries)

Hard Mode

Other Bingo Square: Published 2020

4/5 Stars

&gt;Nick Bell? Not extraordinary. But being the most popular fanfiction writer in the Extraordinaries fandom is a superpower, right?  
&gt;  
&gt;After a chance encounter with Shadow Star, Nova City’s mightiest hero (and Nick’s biggest crush), Nick sets out to make himself extraordinary. And he’ll do it with or without the reluctant help of Seth Gray, Nick's best friend (and maybe the love of his life).

Is this a perfect book? Absolutely not. Did this book bring me immense amounts of joy? ***YES***.

This book was *extremely* cliché. You could guess everything after the first two chapters. The main character was not that smart, but in an endearing way. It was so fun to scream about this book. Highly recommend.

It loses a star for 1) it's clichés and 2) this is a very pro-cop book, and that was... not great.

**VERDICT:**

To Be Taught, If Fortunate was such a wonderful, bittersweet book about hope. The Extraordinaries is hilarious and fun. These are the books to read if you want optimism. The Bird King was alright, but not up to pare with the others and stay away from the audiobook.

176,Fantasy,Most of the so-called 'Tolkien clones' are a fundamentally different type of story,"This is something that I'm sure others have noticed and discussed but I've been thinking about it a lot lately. Most of the high fantasy series that I've heard called Tolkien clones, or more specifically LotR clones, have a fundamentally different underlying theme to them, mainly about the acquisition of power vs. throwing away of power, and the defeat of evil through force vs. the defeat of evil through sacrifice. 

For example, the Wheel of Time, which is a great series that I love, has been called the best of the Tolkien clones by some, and I actually picked it up on the recommendation that it was Tolkienesque, as I had just finished aSoIaF and the First Law and wanted something less grimdark. But while what I guess what you could call the ""superficialities"" are like (dark lord, naive/inexperienced protagonist, magical items, long epic quest) the fundamentals are different. Spoilers: &gt;!Rand's journey was one of him growing in power, an emperor seizing control of the world, bringing war and ruin in his wake, even if it was ultimately to stop the destruction of the world!&lt; It could not be further from Frodo's journey if it tried. Similar thing with the much-maligned (but one of my favorite series tbh) Inheritance Cycle. It's a power fantasy, a term which could not be applied to LotR even remotely. &gt;!Even though he did shun some political power at the end of the series,!&lt; Eragon's journey could not be more different than Frodo's journey. &gt;!Eragon gained ridiculous amounts of power throughout his journey, becoming a battlefield champion. He's the video game PC that storms into the black tower to confront the dark lord,!&lt; not the timid hobbit who is filled with fear and trepidation, but goes on this perilous quest because he knows it is his duty to the world.

If anyone, Eragon and Rand could be better compared to Aragon, but even that is a superficial comparison. Just because a character has a 'rise to power' arc doesn't make them similar at all.

The Sword of Shannara is probably the most blatant Tolkien clone, but that is because the plot, characters, and creatures of the book have almost one-to-one comparisons to LotR. I could not finish the first book because I got sick of thinking it was a blatant ripoff, even though I know that the sequels and prequels are supposed to better and more original.

I'm sure one of you guys could word this better or have your own thoughts on what the fundamental themes of LotR are. Maybe some people who have read more fantasy than I have can bring up some other 'Tolkien clones' and how they actually hold up in similarity to Tolkien."

180,Fantasy,Review: The Siege of Skyhold by John Bierce (Mage Errant #5),"I'm not gonna say much, because it's hard not to spoil things otherwise, but The Siege of Skyhold contains probably the most insane, epic battle I've read in fantasy.

I guess it's not a spoiler to say that there's a siege in this. It's in the title, after all. The book can basically be divided into two parts: before the siege, and the siege. Both are really masterfully handled, and the reason for that largely boils down to Bierce's skill with worldbuilding.

While a large portion of the book can be summed up as the characters just ""waiting,"" this section is never dull. Whether we're watching relationships grow and deepen between characters old and new, or mastering new magical techniques, or learning about aspects of the world, it's always compelling and keeps you engaged. The amount of detail Bierce has put into this world's magic, its cultures, and its history always astounds me, and it's on full display here. Not to mention the breadcrumbs he's laying that help set up the big battle and the future of the series.

Then in the battle, somehow Bierce is able to keep every chapter feeling fresh and exciting despite the amount of pages this thing lasts. There are so many wild setpieces, filled with a huge number of colorful characters (both human and non-), you're barely given a chance to catch your breath before the next one comes along. But with such a huge, varied cast that all possess wildly different abilities, Bierce's cleverness in how the characters employ them and how he matches opponents up together never gets anywhere near dull. It's not just endless pages of the same type of action over and over again; there's something new and unexpected, both small- and large-scale, happening on every page.

But action is nothing without emotional stakes, and I'll simply say that the book delivers this in spades as well. I won't say any more, though!

With The Siege of Skyhold, John Bierce has once more topped his own action and worldbuilding while setting up what will surely prove to be an epic final act of the Mage Errant series.

**5/5**

181,Fantasy,Four Mini Bingo Reviews - Self Published,"**Background:** I've set myself a stretch goal of filling four cards (100 books) for this year's bingo. As I read four books for each square, I'll share my mini reviews - and will also be forcing myself to pick the book I think best represents the spirit of the square and/or that I most enjoyed reading. 

**Thoughts on this square**: Before I became a regular on r/fantasy, I never would have dared to read any self-pub material - I'm so glad the sub has opened my eyes to some of the great stuff out there. 

**Reviews** 

[The Lord of Stariel (Stariel #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41838393-the-lord-of-stariel) by A.J. Lancaster 

Rating: 3.5/5

Other squares: Romantic fantasy 

*The Lord of Stariel* is a charming Edwardian fantasy romance. Hetta has returned home to the Stariel estate to discover who will be its next Lord… but whoever is chosen will have to immediately deal with Stariel’s fae neighbours, who have crossed the border again. This book took a while to get going, but once the plot kicked off, I really enjoyed it. It’s mostly a fun, light-hearted take on both historical fantasy and traditional fae tropes, but there is solid character growth and I never get tired of a good childhood friends to lovers romance.

[By Sea &amp; Sky: An Esowon Story (The Sky Pirate Chronicles #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51069298-by-sea-sky) by Antoine Bandele 

Rating: 2/5

Other squares: Published in 2020

I loved the premise of this book: a Caribbean-inspired pseudo-steampunk pirate story, featuring a husband and wife pirate team. Unfortunately, this was no swashbuckling adventure, but rather an experience in existential monotony. None of the characters were given any genuine backstory or personality (and our married MCs barely interacted before being separated for plot reasons), the world-building relied solely on already knowing that All Empires are Evil, and the plot itself was just a series of action sequences tied together with a flimsy bit of string. The more I read, the more I just didn’t care what happened to anyone. 

[Beneath Black Sails (Beneath Black Sails #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51224985-beneath-black-sails) by Clare Sager 

Rating: 4/5

Other squares: Published in 2020, romantic fantasy

This book was so much fun. Lady Vice is the most notorious pirate in the land. Knigh Blackwood hunts pirates for living. When they're forced to work together... what could possibly go wrong? Or right? I love pirates, and this one nailed all the tropes with gusto - hidden secrets, buried treasure, epic sea battles, and plenty of romantic tension. I did have a few small quibbles about the world-building not being as thorough as it could be, but otherwise I was all aboard for this adventure. 

[The Dragon's Banker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49405286-the-dragon-s-banker?) by Scott Warren

Rating: 3/5

Other squares: Optimistic 

Sailor Kelstern is a down on his luck merchant banker, when he's offered an opportunity he can't refuse... becoming financier for a dragon. As an economist, I thought I would love this one, but it was pretty much the definition of an average book. The characters were interesting but not particularly memorable. The plot clipped along (and surprisingly managed to incorporate a lesson in banking 101 without *too* much infodumping) but never turned into a page turner. And it was occasionally witty but never actually outright funny.  

**If you could only read one**: I had so much fun with **Beneath Black Sails** and can't wait to read the sequel.

183,Fantasy,"(Book Recommendations) Feminine Angels, Vampires or Such","Hey guys

I’m looking for some books recommendations where the main character is a guy, either a human or just very low power if a supernatural being, and he gets accompanied, helped, guided by a much stronger feminine presence, either an angel or vampire or a similarly powerful yet pleasant being. She could be evil, preferably not (just in case there are not enough suggestions), but at least someone you can root for and/or with some potential to eventually turn to the good side. It can be romance or not, the genre does not matter much, probably some kind of SF&amp;F.

Thank you!"
184,Fantasy,Exploration fantasy request?,Can somebody recommend a fantasy book/series where exploration and survival is the theme. Like discovering an unexplored landmass with new magical fauna. Discovering ancient primordial beasts that have been long dead on the continent the explorers came from.  Getting lost in a magical jungle or starving and freezing to death in a magical icy climate. Preferably following one main character as he experiences the horror of untamed magic wilderness. The MC should preferably have some form of magic that he can control. I'm essentially looking for a survival horror with strong magic elements. Thank you for reading my post.

187,Fantasy,"Free, standalone fantasy novella, The Seeker and the Sword.","Hi guys!

My fantasy novella, *The Seeker and the Sword*, just went free on Amazon!

Now, it *is* a prequel novella, but it's completely standalone. You can read it before or after you read the first book in the series, *A Dark Inheritance*. Or, you can read it and never read the series. Up to you!

Here's the blurb:

&gt;**Evil stalks the streets of Hirlcrest. A mage walks free among the empire. And a young woman is determined to prove herself…**  
&gt;  
&gt;Lilah is a seeker in training. All her life she has dreamt of being a part of the sacred order of warriors with only one goal: seek out magic—*evil*—and destroy it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Her dream is on the verge of becoming a reality. A seeker is retiring, and the next of the order is to be chosen.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, a murder has been committed in the city, a murder that could have only been done with magic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lilah and the other recruits are tasked with finding the perpetrator, and the test of who is to become the next seeker turns deadlier than she could have ever imagined.  
&gt;  
&gt;***The Seeker and the Sword*** **is a standalone prequel novella set in the world of the** ***Hollow Fate*** **series, several years before the first book,** ***A Dark Inheritance*****, begins.**

188,Fantasy,My short story Chain Reaction is finally out at The Journey Into Podcast for everyone to enjoy.,"It’s finally here.  At long last Chain Reaction, my story from The Journey Into Podcast short story writing contest, has arrived.  And it’s a full cast production with all sorts of talented voice actors.  Nick Griffalco and Arthur Hikma have entered a contest to win $100,000.  They must be the final ones to get off a roller coaster.  However, one night Nick hears the roller coaster talking to him.  It wants him to be the prophet of a new religion based around roller coasters.  Arthur thinks Nick has completely lost it.  He is determined to get Nick to snap out it before he goes completely off the rails.  It’s sure to be one wild ride.  

As I said, this story was part of the Journey Into Journey short story writing contest from the Journey Into Podcast.  Twelve people entered, but only six people, counting me, submitted stories.  We were each assigned a different song from the band Journey.  The title of the song would be the title of our story, and we build the story around the title.  We also had to include at least two phrases from the song, of at least four words each somewhere in story.  The story could be about whatever we wanted. 

Third, second, and first place included monetary prizes plus getting your story produced on the podcast.  Third place is $5, second place is $10, and first place is $25.  Of course, publication order is, third, second, then first.  I won third place, and as far as I’m concerned, I got the best deal, since that meant I was first to get my story produced.  The true reward, for me, was always to hear my story produced in full cast audio.  

We’ve got Norm Sherman from The Drabblecast as our main character Nick, and he nails the role so well.  Well, this story probably wouldn’t be out of place at The Drabblecast.  Dave Robison uses his deep authoritative voice to great effect as the Rollar Coster God, and Marshall Latham himself gives a surprisingly spot-on performance as Arthur.  There were many other characters with minor roles, but voice actors who gave exception performances.  For example, Rish Outfeild gives a surprisingly fun performance as minor character Sean.  His right hand man Big Anklevich cameos as AJ, another minor character.  Tena Kolakowski Actually sounds pretty close to how I imagine Gwen sounding.  Meanwhile, Bria Burton does a respectable job as Arrhur’s girlfriend Molly.  Great performances all around. 

But enough about me gushing about the excellent cast.  Go listen to this story yourself and enjoy it.

191,Fantasy,Getting to Know Individual Characters before Having them Combine Forces or the Other Way Around?,"I was thinking about fantasy novels / series / movies / games and how they handle the plot device of introducing various characters, especially in stories involving a group of protagonists or antagonists.

Two main ways are usually used in this plot device - either each character is introduced separately, and given time to develop across books, movies or episodes and then characters start to converge in one or more groups and the other way is to start the story with a group of various individuals and throughout the book or game, the plot of each character is developed. These two methods can be found in one literary or media work sometimes.

I will provide some examples on both cases to illustrate my point.

**Individual character development followed by grouping:**

\- Stormlight Archive: each character starts in a separate place and then they converge. Each character even has their backstory developed in a separate book

\- MCU: several individual movies for each of the protagonists lead to a convergence (I love using this word to stan Malazan :)) )

**Group then individual development:**

\- Final Fantasy VII: they start more or less as a group, then throughout the game, each character gets their own chapter to develop their plots

\- Gargoyles: each episode focuses on one or a combination of characters on an A-plot or B-plot

\- Damon Lindelof shows: Lost, The Leftovers, the TV adaptation of Watchmen also follow this formula where we start with a group of people and then each episode focuses on a certain character's story.

In general, books and media where each character gets their time to shine are much more preferable to me than media where side characters never get enough spotlight (looking at you Fringe with Astrid).

What other examples of the above two plot devices have you come across in Fantasy books?"

197,Fantasy,Books or series that are better on audiobook?,"Scifi is welcome too.

I've been walking a bunch and I like to listen to audiobooks as I walk. I don't like the idea of just listening to a book I intend on reading (since audiobooks take significantly longer to listen to than to read in book form, and with some of the harder fantasy books I feel I might get lost without the ability to reread bits). 

So, I wonder: are there books or series you'd recommend that are actually better on audiobook?"
198,Fantasy,Looking for action heavy books translated to English from another Language. Bonus if Super Powers are involved.,"I thought about just asking for translated superhero/villain books, but I don't expect there to be a ton of them so I thought I'd go more general. I've read as many superhero books as I can get my hands on, with more to go on the TBR, but I've never even heard of any that are translated, so if anyone knows of any I would appreciate it.

So far when it comes to speculative fiction, the only ones I've read that are like what I'm asking for are All you Need is Kill and The Witcher. Those are both from very different authors and are very different genres, but that is the kind of thing I like. Anything works as long as it falls under the speculative fiction umbrella, there's lots of action, and it was originally written in a different language. I just want to try to expand my pool of options a bit with translated works, and my favorites always tend to be action packed."

204,Fantasy,Obligatory Bingo Card Review,"Ahoy wonderful people of r/fantasy.  This is my first year of Bingo and needless to say, it was certainly amusing.  Note that I have more extensive reviews of each book after I read them (with the exception of two which I am including here).  Needless to say, it was a fun journey, a bunch of books I would not normally read were read.   Enjoy!

**First Row Across:**

* **Novel Translated from its Original Language** \- **Blood of Elves** by *Andrezj Sapkowski* This is the first novel in the Witcher series, and it is enjoyable.  I would say that the short stories are objectively better, but as a fan of the series, I did enjoy it.  However, there are certainly issues with the book, social issue wise.

* **Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold** \- **Spinning Silver** by *Naomi Novik*.  A retelling of Rumpelstiltskin using a badass woman who has to become miserly to fix her father’s failing business.  Oh but this captures the attention of the all powerful.  The plot was certainly unique and I appreciated it.
 
* **Optimistic SFF** \- **The House in the Cerulean Sea** by *TJ Klune* it was amazing how an onion processing factory was magically constructed in my living room.  They finished their work when I finished the book.  Funny how they coincided.

* **Novel Featuring Necromancy** \- **The Library at Mount Char** by *Scott Hawkins*. God this was a weird book.  I have no other way of describing how brutal and odd and strangely beautifully tragic it is.

* **Ace / Aro Spec Fic** \- **The Cybernetic Tea Shop** by *Meredith Katz*. I admit this was one of the titles that I would normally not pick up.  I was going to go with the popular pick of Murderbot, but something said to read this instead.  I do not regret it.  It was, for lack of better words, a warm cup of tea for the soul.

**Second Row Across:**

* **Novel Featuring a Ghost** \- **Ninth House** by *Leigh Bardugo*.  I enjoyed this book so much.  I have a fondness for the etherial nature of New England, and then throw in the university setting, and ghosts.  It was well written and told a unique story.

* **Novel Featuring Exploration** \- **Paradox Bound** by *Peter Clines* a timey wimey, wibbly wobbly journey that I have not seen recommended on here before.  The exploration is across the United States for the American dream.  Except the American dream is something that is tangible.  Oh yeah, there is a bad ass female protagonist.

* **Climate Fiction** \- SUBSTITUTION - Top Book of 2017 **The Blade Itself** by *Joe Abercrombie*.  I am excited to continue the First Law series, but I would agree with most that this is a bit slow on the uptake.  Everything is shit, and everyone is in pain, and there are people dying and everything is shit.   Much grim, so dark.

* **Novel with a Colour in the Title** \- **Red Sister** by *Mark Lawrence*. This was my first exposure to Mark Lawrence, and I must say I was impressed.  I thought that the story did not meander and was a quick enjoyable read.  I look forward to reading more about the badass nuns.

* **Any** [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) **Book Club Book of the Month OR** [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) **Read-along Book** \- **The Bone Ships** by *RJ Barker*. Okay, this was one of my MVP candidates for Bingo.  I am normally not a nautical person with regards to books, but god damn, I was entranced by everything.  Lucky Meas is a badass captain (I feel like I read a lot of stories with badass women in it this year - not upset by this) and the story that unfolds is captivating.

**Third Row Across:**

* **Self-Published SFF Novel** \- **The Carnival of the Night** by *Nicholas Carey*. Hmmm.  This was okay at best.  The story is unique with some interesting twists involving gods and tricksters, but it was just okay.  Not bad, but okay.

* **Novel with Chapter Epigraphs** \- **Senlin Ascends** by *Josiah Bancroft*. This book is also in my MVP list for the year.  It is such a unique story and I want to see how it develops further.  They are on my kindle just waiting to be read.  Senlin starts as a meek protagonist who starts to take the mystical tower by storm towards the end, except he is a long way from finding his love.

* **Novel Published in 2020** \- **The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives In Your Home: A Welcome to Night Vale Novel** by *Jeffrey Cranor and Joseph Fink*. Even for Night Vale, this was strange.  I was not expecting a swashbuckling pirate story that turns...intense.  This is a revenge story at its heart.  It does however explain who the Faceless Old Woman is and makes listening to old episodes of Night Vale more entertaining.

* **Novel Set in a School or University** \- **A Deadly Education** by *Naomi Novik* except my dumbass already used her so I had to quickly read **Vita Nostra** by *Maryna and Sergio Dyachenko*. While these two books are inherently different, they are also dark.  Really dark in its core.  Both are enjoyable, but then again, I have a twisted sense of humor.

* **Book About Books** \- **The Starless Sea** by *Erin Morgenstern*. For those looking for a sequel of **The Night Circus**, you will not be finding it here.  This book is not about a story, it is about half-formed ideas and the emotion it brings forth.  It may be one of the most interesting books I read this year, but I do not know if that is good or bad.

**Fourth Row Across:**

* **A Book that Made You Laugh** \- **Storm Front** by *Jim Butcher*.  Is Harry Dresden a misogynist in this book?  Yes.  Can I overlook it and find humor in his snark?  Yes.  Would others?  Maybe not.  I enjoyed it as a palate cleanser, but for some it may leave a bad taste in their mouth.

* **Five SFF Short Stories** \- **Exhalation** by Ted Chiang.  This collection of stories is a masterclass of science fiction mixed with raw emotion.  After reading each story, I sat there and thought about how this story was going to affect me.  Highly recommend these stories.

* **Big Dumb Object** \- **Foundryside** by  *Robert Jackson Bennett*, a heist story with unique magic, with F-F romance, with releasing the power of the gods?  Did I sell it enough?

* **Feminist Novel** \- **Mexican Gothic** by *Silvia Moreno-Garcia* A horror book where you feel the walls closing in on you.  I would say that this is not the most common definition of feminist, and there is much more on my review, but her analysis on eugenics was quite interesting.  Oh yeah, the walls are closing in around you the entire time - literally and metaphorically.

* **Novel by a Canadian Author** \- **A Brightness Long Ago** by *Guy Gabriel Kay*.   This was my first exposure to GGK and dammit, his writing is silky smooth and poignant.  I am now buying stock in all of his works.  Historical fiction with a flash of fantasy.  I look forward to Lions and all his other works.

**Fifth Row Across:**

* **Novel with a Number in the Title** \- **Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City** by *KJ Parker*.  An unreliable narrator takes you on a tour-de-force on how he single handedly saved his world, but did he?

* **Romantic Fantasy / Paranormal Romance** \- **Outlander** by *Diana Gabaldon*. This was a re-read for me.  This is maybe one of the only Outlander books in which the romance is the main focus of the plot as if it did not exist, the book would crumble.  Likewise, it ends with a ‘happy for now.’  There are a lot of issues with Outlander, mostly with the sexual abuse, though, to be fair, men and women are on the receiving end, and it it set in a time where it maybe occurred more, though it remains unsettling.  However, I do think it is a book that people should read.

* **Novel with a Magical Pet** \- **The Bear and the Nightingale** by *Kathleen Ardin*. A magical pony.  A magical pony in a fairytale like setting, that is beautiful.  In my mind’s eye, it takes me to a time and place that I will never be able to visit, but let’s me be a fly on the wall.

* **Format: Graphic Novel (at least 1 vol.) OR Audiobook / Audio drama** \- **Watchmen** by *Alan Moore*. Woo-wee, this is dark.  The tv show on HBO is true to the graphic novel compared to the movie.  Reminder that this is written in the 1980s when the world was legitimately minutes to midnight (i.e. nuclear holocaust).  This is a grim representation of how the world reacts to all these events in an alternate reality.  Like the song asks, “who watches the watchmen?” Is the main question that should be answered, but is never.

* **Novel Featuring Politics** \- **Jade City** by *Fonda Lee*. My last MVP for the year.  I did not know what I was going to expect going into this book, and boy was it fun.  Some events occur that you DO NOT expect and it made the world feel that much grittier.  I do not want to ruin the twists and turns of the novel, but feel free to read my previous review.

Overall, I had a fun year participating in my first Bingo.  I look forward to next year!"
205,Fantasy,Fantasy series with proper nouns in the title?,"I’ve noticed lately that a lot of fantasy (particularly YA fantasy) is full of common nouns and adjectives. And looking back, a lot of my favorite fantasy books were the names of interesting characters or fantastic worlds. 

Harry Potter is an obvious one, but I also liked Artemis Fowl and Abarat. 

What are some other great fantasy books with proper names in the titles?"

I've seen recommendations for Bernard Cornwell's 'The Warlord Chronicles' but I read that it doesn't have magic and other fantasy elements. Does anyone know of a version in a historical setting but where magic exists?
216,Fantasy,One Mike to Read them All: “The Calculating Stars” by Mary Robinette Kowal,"I was going back and forth on whether to review this as a good work of diamond-hard science fiction or as a powerful intersectional feminist story. It is all of those things, and it is awesome, so I’m not going to worry about it and just talk about what it was like to read the book.

The premise is that there’s a major asteroid strike off the East Coast of the US in the 1950s. While the tsunami and the pressure wave and the firestorm are all devastating, the long real problem is the effect on the climate. There’s going to be a few years of very cold weather, owing to all the dust kicked up by the strike, but once the dust (literally) settles, there’s going to be a bigger problem: the asteroid through enough stuff into the atmosphere to start a runaway greenhouse effect, one that will leave Earth uninhabitable in the not-too-distant future. World governments generally accept this warning from scientists (in a perfect world this shouldn't be the most unbelievable part of a science fiction story, but here we are) and begin an ambitious space program with the goal of establishing colonies so that humanity won’t go extinct.

What follows is something very close to the real-world Apollo program, but a few years earlier and greatly accelerated. I assume the sequels will move beyond that - this book stops before there’s a manned lunar mission.

The book is told from the perspective of a woman named Elma, wife of a rocket engineer in the fictional version of NASA. In her own right she’s got PhDs in math and physics, is an accomplished pilot, and is capable of incredible calculations in her head. In other words, she’d make a great astronaut … too bad she’s a woman.

The focusing story for the book is Elma’s efforts to get women accepted as astronauts, and it’s a damned powerful story of sexism (and racism and anti-Semitism). I don’t really feel like there’s much I can or should say about it, because as a straight white dude this is all so far outside of my experience. I will say, however, that when I was about 75% through the book I told the friend that recommended the book to me that “if at least one of these women doesn’t lose her shit over all the bullshit they’re being put through, I’m going to lose mine.”

One thing that I wish Mary Robinette Kowal had addressed more explicitly was the effect of the asteroid so soon after the Holocaust. Those who have read the book might be surprised to see me say this, because Elma and her husband are both Jewish. In the aftermath of the Holocaust they embraced their Jewish identity. And Elma’s family mostly lived in Charleston, and are presumed to have been killed when the tsunami hit. So soon after all the deaths of more distant relations in Europe, this hits Elma hard. The one point I wish Kowal had touched on: the Holocaust killed roughly 6 million Jews, which was about one out of every three Jews on the planet. In the 1950s there were more than 2 million Jews living in New York alone, plus substantial Jewish communities in other cities on the East Coast. I’m married to a literal Holocaust scholar, so I know more about all this than most, but I immediately thought about how substantial a percentage of the surviving Jews would have been wiped out by the asteroid. It’s not a small number.

Sorry to end on a down note, but this really is an excellent book. It’s also a good choice for the Climate Bingo square (hard mode). And it’s actually my last Bingo square. Huzzah!

217,Fantasy,ThIs book will not only equip you with character development techniques but will also entertain and capture your heart. Below are the effective ways on how you can develop your characters for your future book:,
218,Fantasy,Do any of you have a “cursed” book?,"Every time I start reading Hyperion, I get really into it, then I get broken up with and stop reading. I know I should stop reading that book when I’m in a relationship, but for some reason, that seems to be the only time when I think I’m comfortable enough to settle in and read. Maybe I’m subconsciously trying to break the cycle and tackle that book, but this has been happening for the past ten years. Maybe I’m a glutton for punishment. What books make bad things happen to you? Am I the only one??"
219,Fantasy,What is Malazan actually about?,"I've heard so many people talk about Malazan, but I've never actually seen someone explain what it's about.  So, what is Malazan about?  Yeah, yeah, I know, monumental plotlines and all that, but what is it about?  What makes the world unique?  What defines the actual story?

For example, I could describe the Silmarillion as a monumental mythic history of Middle Earth, which is a rather useless description, or I could describe it as an epic tale of three beautiful jewels, the pride of their creator, the wars fought over them, and how they tie into the fate of all Middle Earth, told in a monumental, mythohistoric biblical manner.  Obviously it's still a lacking description, but at least it conveys some more useful information for a potential reader.  

What is a similar description of Malazan, as detailed or more (the more the merrier)?

Please keep spoilers to a minimum."
220,Fantasy,This may be a bit odd to say but I prefer my fantasy in animated form than live action.,"Shows like Dragon Prince, anime, Hilda etc."
221,Fantasy,Character names,"So, I'd say I'm not good at coming up with names, typically using basic or modern names for characters. To fantasy readers and writers out there, does that matter to you? Would a character in a fantasy work need a fancy, extravagant name? This is something I noticed in fantasy works. Characters don't have names like Sam or Max or Kevin. For example...

Httyd: Hiccup

GoT: Daenerys

LotR: Frodo

and more. The only fantasy book character name that's normal that I can think of is Harry Potter. So does a cool and unique name make a story better? Or does it not matter?"
222,Fantasy,Unique fantasy novels?,"I need some recommendations for unique fantasy novels. I'm talking about books that have elements to them that you've never seen replicated elsewhere; a world that has a distinct feel that is all its own, unique story beats, or characters you wouldn't normally see. I'm looking for things that don't feel like your run-of-the-mill battle between the forces of good against evil, or that centre around political intrigue in a faux-Medieval world. Any suggestions?"
223,Fantasy,"Just read mistborn hero of ages, a couple thoughts - mistborn spoilers","So I just finished the first mistborn trilogy and while overall I really liked the series I had a couple issues with the ending.  Namely:

- everyone is chillin in the afterlife. To me, this lessens the importance of death .

- Sazed now seems a little op. Like is no one going to have problems anymore? I guess this is addressed in later mistborn stuff but even so. 

- In a similar vein, I was kinda ambivalent about the whole Sazed needs to have faith arc.

I don’t fault Sanderson for making these choices, I think we may just have different world views. They did annoy me a bit though and I wonder how others feel.

Like I said, I really liked the series overall and am planning to read storm light archive next."
224,Fantasy,My 2020 Book Bingo,"  

Thoughts on doing my first bingo. I really liked it! I got most of my recommendations from r/Fantasy, and it certainly made me read books I would not have otherwise. In introduced me to many new series and authors, that I continued reading from. About halfway through the year I realized I hadn’t paid for any of the books yet, so I added an extra challenge to myself was to get all the books for free! Many of the books were from the library, but I also borrowed some from family and read books from free giveaways. It broadened my reading experience as I had never listened to audiobooks before, but some of the books were only available in audiobook. Now I really like listening to audiobooks.

Most of my squares ended up being Hard Mode, however I did not get enough for the whole bingo card to be Hard Mode. For next time I will write down my reviews when I finished reading them, as some of the details are a little hazy now.

First row

1.Novel Translated from its Original Language: The Rabbit Back Literature Society by Pasi Ilmari Jaaskelainen-Hard Mode

A Finnish schoolteacher gets invited to an elite group of secretive writers. The mystery kept me intrigued and I liked the plot point that the characters could sneak up on each other and demand secrets.

2. Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold: Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K.Le Guin- Hard Mode

A human envoy travels to Winter and tries to convince the planet to join a wider alliance. I understand this is a classic and landmark science fictions book however, I found it okay. I just did not connect to it. 

3. Optimistic SFF: The Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett-Hard Mode

Loved this! Tiffany Aching is one a mission to save her brother, with the help of what might be the best sidekicks the Nac Mac Feegle.I finished reading the whole trilogy and then went on to read more Terry Pratchett. I had only read the Colour of Magic before and had thought it was just okay. Now I am working through the Discworld.

  

4. Novel Featuring Necromancy; Servant of the Underworld by Aliette de Bodard

The high priest of the dead, Actal must find a high priestess that disappeared from a room covered in blood. The Aztec setting was interesting, and I enjoyed it, however it is basically a whodunnit.

  

5. Ace / Aro Spec Fic: Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie-Hard Mode

A unique take on the book being from the point of view of an AI of a vast spaceship, that is stuck with a single human body. I enjoyed the whole trilogy. 

  

Second row

6. Novel Featuring a Ghost: Saga Volume 1-7 by Brian Vaughan 

This was the first real graphic novel series I got into. It is a Romeo and Juliet story of a couple whose races are at war with each other. They are trying to keep their daughter and their family safe. I thought the visuals really helped show the craziness of the different planets and adventures. 

  

7. Novel Featuring Exploration: Within The Sanctuary of Wings: A memoir by Lady Trent by Marie Brennan

This whole series is great! This is fifth book in the series, where the Lady Trent who is a dragon biologist must explore to far flung mountains to find her most exciting discovery. I love how curious and determined Lady Trent is. 

  

8. Climate Fiction: The Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal

An alternate view of the space race if a meteorite had hit the earth and precipitated more of an urgency to be able to colonize space. I liked the main’s characters absolute drive to become the first female astronaut while dealing with 1950’s society expectation. I also liked that she had a loving relationship and partnership with her husband,

  

9. Novel with a Colour in the Title: The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon- Hard Mode

I saw this recommended all over this sub, and for the right reasons, it is amazing.

  

10. Any [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) Book Club Book of the Month OR [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) Read-along

The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson

I liked this book up until the ending. I get that was the point however I just ended up mad at the main character. I did not continue on reading the series. 

  

Third row

11. Self-Published SFF Novel: A wizard’s Guide to Defensive Baking by T.Kingfisher

I loved this book! Found it so whimsical and charming! I have now read all the books by this author my library has and enjoyed them all. 

  

12. Novel with Chapter Epigraphs: Master Assassins Robert V.S Redick-Hard Mode

I liked the relationship between the brothers in this. I thought it was intricate and complicated. I thought it was a not often explored relationship. I will read the sequel when it comes out. 

  

13. Novel Published in 2020: Queen of Coin and Whispers by Helen Corcoran-Hard Mode

A teenager becomes spymaster for a kingdom, while falling in love with the Queen.

It was a pleasant read, not the most memorable or deep but perfectly fine YA fantasy novel. 

14. Novel Set in a School or University: Skyward by Brandon Sanderson-Hard Mode 

On a planet where humanity is trapped beneath the surface, while they are attacked by mysterious ships, pilots are the biggest heroes. Spensa attends pilot school to follow her dreams. I like Brandon Sanderson, and this was not exception. I thought it was a good addition to the trope of novel set in schools. 

  

15. Book about Books: Book: The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern

A mysterious world full of stories, and the journey to reach it and explore it. You become immersed in the world described and do not want to leave it when the book is done.

  

Fourth row

16. A Book that Made You Laugh: Fred the Vampire Accountant by Drew Hayes-Hard Mode

A totally normal accountant gets turned into a vampire. He gets sucked into this new world. I liked that Fred didn’t seem to change personality wise at all with his undead life, and stumbles through the shenanigans he finds himself in.

  

17. Five SFF Short Stories: Because you Love to hate me; 13 Stories of Villainy edited by Ameriie- Hard Mode

I did like some of the short stories more than the others, but I liked the concept as a whole.

  

18. Big Dumb Object: Rosewater by Tade Thompson-Hard Mode

I do not think I would of finished this book except for the fact I was reading it for bingo. The pace seemed slow. Or I just found it boring. I did like the setting of Future Nigeria. 

  

19. Feminist Novel: The Lady’s Guide to Petticoats and Piracy by Mackenzi Lee

Felicity is trying to escape society proscribed role for her and become a scientist. I did read the first book a gentlemen’s Guide to Vice and Virtue, although I guess you could read this as a standalone. Plus, there are seas monsters! This would also work for the Ace / Aro Spec Fic bingo card.

  

20. Novel by a Canadian Author: Hominids by Robert Sawyer

One of the only books I did not get recommend from reddit! I have not seen this discussed much on reddit. There is a portal to a parallel universe where Neanderthals became the dominate species. It was an interesting take on how society would be different, and how individuals would adjust to switching. I continued to read the entire series. The only part that annoyed me was the SPOILERS was the rape subplot.

  

Fifth row

21. Novel with a Number in the Title: Harrow the Ninth By Tamsyn Muir

I was mainly confused throughout this book. I certainly thought it was different. I did like the main character Harrow though. 

  

22. Romantic Fantasy / Paranormal Romance: Radiance by Grace Draven

I though that was a cute take on an arranged marriage between members of a different species. 

  

23. Novel with a Magical Pet: Jhereg by Steven Brust

This is one of the books I should have written my review of at the time. All I remember is I didn’t like it. I will not continue this series. 

  

24. Format: Graphic Novel (at least 1 vol.) OR Audiobook / Audio drama: Through the Woods Emily Carroll

Is a series of five creepy short stories in graphic novel form. I did try to read this on an app on my tablet, which I have to say sucked as a form for graphic novels. However, that is not the book’s fault. 

  

25. Novel Featuring Politics: Too like the Lightening by Ada Palmer

A convict in a 25th century utopia must travel the world helping other. I found the worldbuilding complex and layered. A lot of discussion of enlightenment. It was interesting, but I think I would not have read it without the Bingo."
225,Fantasy,How do I contact the moderaters?,They took down my thread and gave me no reason. How do I contact them?
226,Fantasy,Has Anyone Tried Netflix's Shera Reboot?,"I recently watched a few episodes of the show and was surprised at how effectively it handled the source material, as with 2011's Thundercats it's a good example of how to properly manage a reboot; an expansive plot, investing cast and gripping narrative. I haven't seen much of the 80s shera it's based but I've seen enough to know it's bizarreness. 

I watched a video a long time ago from a channel called Samantha Aimee that convinced me to attempt the show, I'll leave it here for anyone interested (it includes one minor spoiler that the creator warns of in advance) [https://youtu.be/nO\_Z45dnuLM](https://youtu.be/nO_Z45dnuLM)"
227,Fantasy,Fantasy books lack magic,"I know, lol right. 

But on a recommendation I read The King of Elfland's daughter. 

Now that is a truly magical book. It also doesn't have a magic system per se. It focuses on wonderment. 

Books that focus on a magic system try to turn it into a mechanical tool which is what Sci-fi does. Science-Fiction isn't actual science, it is experimental (imaginary) technology which is based on an imagined future. 

Many Sci-fi fans migrated over to fantasy (a genre totally different) and have used magic into another tool of mechanical story telling. The beauty of the genre is so different that doing this seems wrong. 

An alternative example is Star Wars. It is a fantasy series with sci-fi elements and the aesthetics of space traversal.    

This is controversial, but I think fantasy should return to its roots and reject science-fiction fans. The latter should go its own way, and the two should stop being grouped together."

233,Fantasy,First time doing an r/Fantasy bingo… and it was great!,"As a summary, the card is visible [here](https://harkale.art/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020-fantasy-bingo-card.pdf). I initially started the challenge to discover a few new writers and subcategories of SFF I’m not familiar with (mainly thanks to recommendations on this subreddit) and ended up with a full card without really realizing it. I made lots of great discoveries and now have a huuuge TBR list full of all the other books written by these amazing authors! 

I enjoyed all the books listed below, for different reasons… but I don’t feel competent enough to give them ratings: the difference between books I consider to be good or absolutely great is just a matter of taste… I’ve realised I especially like reading about people peopling (they have realistic personalities, the good guys are trying to understand others and aiming to be better people), soft magic system (mysterious events rather than codified rules of magic), in original settings and with beautiful, poetic prose. I’ve added hearts (**&lt;3**) before the titles I loved most and would absolutely recommend to people who don’t dislike the things I listed above :)

So here are the mini-reviews, feel free to let me know if I did anything wrong, and I hope they will make you want to discover some of these books!

&amp;#x200B;

# First row:

**&lt;3 Novel Translated from its Original Language**: Kenji Miyazawa - *Night Train to the Milky Way*.

It’s actually a collection of poetic, dreamlike short stories about humanity, kindness, and the beauty of our world. The main one, *Night Train to the Milky Way*, tells the story of a boy who takes a train through the night sky with his best friend. It’s a beautiful tale about loss and grief, written after the author lost his sister, and one of the most touching texts I’ve ever read… It’s my favourite read on this card, and I deeply recommend it if you’re OK with your eyes turning into fountains (plus, it was published after the author’s death about a century ago, so it’s probably in the public domain and available for free online) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold**: Ursula Le Guin - *The Left Hand of Darkness*.

We discover a planet where people are neither male nor female through the eyes of a man from our own Earth. Le Guin builds a very convincing society, with its complex interactions and subtle differences from our own world, in which the story unfolds, dealing with prejudice on both sides and trying to relate to others despite their differences. I loved discovering this world through the point of view of a biased outsider, trying to figure out what he didn’t understand (and often failing).

&amp;#x200B;

**Optimistic SFF**: Katherine Addison - *The Goblin Emperor*.

Maia, a half-goblin outcast, is suddenly put on the throne of an elven kingdom. It took me a while to figure out why this was so often recommended as an optimistic SFF book: the court is fond of gossip and backstabbing and the main character is just so lonely (and needs a big hug)… But then, he’s a genuinely good person who wants to do what’s best for everyone and who’s extremely considerate of others, and power doesn’t manage to corrupt him. He’s a great character (and he still deserves that hug)!

&amp;#x200B;

**&lt;3 Novel Featuring Necromancy**: R. J. Barker - *The Bone Ships*.

I love that universe. It has ships made of bones, creepy necromancy and an unjust social structure on one hand, and gorgeous nature, mysterious magic and bird-people on the other hand. I like the other hand better, obviously, but the contrast is fantastic. The characters are great, too, and so are the visual descriptions, with all their rich colours (the black or white ships, blue and red paint, pink or purple plants,…): the book is high on my to-make-fanart-of list, and I’m looking forward to reading the next one in the series!

Also, side notes: the writer isn’t K. J. Parker, and bird-people aren’t called Guillaume. It’s all very confusing and it took me longer than I am willing to admit to figure it out.

&amp;#x200B;

**&lt;3 Ace / Aro Spec Fic:** two novellas here, Meredith Katz - *The Cybernetic Teashop* and Seanan McGuire - *Every Heart a Doorway*.

I loved both these stories and added everything else by the writers to my TBR! The first one is a romance between a programmer and a robot, with lots of tea and caring for each other. Before reading it, I thought I wasn’t a fan of romance stories, but the protagonists stole my heart and I’m glad to be wrong. 

The second is a beautiful story as well, about children stranded away from the dreamworlds they used to live in… It’s about melancholy and loss, and hope too. I love McGuire’s delicate prose, and I’m looking forward to reading the other books in that series!

&amp;#x200B;

# Second Row:

**Novel Featuring a Ghost**: two shorter books here too, Oscar Wilde - *The Canterville Ghost* and William Shakespeare – *Hamlet*.

The first one is part of a book of short stories/novellas: an American family buys a haunted English manor. They didn’t believe in ghosts, but this ghost is clearly real and also far too noisy. It’s a fun story, often more on the acerbic side (I mean, it’s Wilde), but surprisingly kind overall!

The second, well, is *Hamlet*. No, I hadn’t read it before. As a non-native English speaker, I found it tough (I had a modern French translation next to the original text to help me understand some sentences, I would have missed a lot without it, and I probably still missed a lot with it). I liked it, but it’s not my favourite among Shakespeare’s works, and I’m not going to elaborate much further here because I’m not a literary critic and I think my ignorance would give the British a good reason to invade Brittany and burn me to the stake (or worse, force me to eat English “food”). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Novel Featuring Exploration**: Matthew Buscemi - *Schrödinger's City*.

A self-published novel which the writer advertised on this subreddit :) We’re following different people who are stuck in a strange city that alternates between two configurations. It’s a really original setting, and I enjoyed exploring it with the characters!

&amp;#x200B;

**&lt;3 Climate fiction**: Mary Robinette Kowal - *The Calculating Stars*.

After a massive cataclysm happened on Earth in the 50s, we follow the efforts of humanity to escape to the stars through the point of view of a NASA employee who ends up having a central role. I love how her obvious competence is displayed in the first chapter, I love the beautiful relationship she has with her husband, and I love how the different kinds of discrimination mirror each other (especially as people realize that others are discriminated against and change their own perspective). It’s just great.

&amp;#x200B;

**Novel with a Colour in the Title**: John Scalzi – *Redshirts*.

I don’t remember the username of the person who recommended that book to me in a discussion about *Galaxy Quest*, but thank you, kind redditor! It’s a hilarious book, probably best appreciated by *Star Trek* fans, that pokes fun at the tropes of the series (especially the alarmingly high deathrate of people wearing red aboard the USS Enterprise).

&amp;#x200B;

**&lt;3 Any** r/fantasy **Book Club Book of the Month OR** r/fantasy **Read-along Book**: Hope Mirrlees - *Lud-in-the-Mist.*

We follow an investigation happening in Dorimare, a modern country (by early 20th century standards) whose inhabitants don’t like to be reminded of their country’s past strong ties with Fairyland, a mysterious place lying beyond Dorimare’s western border. It’s a wonderful book, with its mix of modern politics and eerie fairy magic, with a gallery of very human characters and written in a beautiful prose. It reminded me a lot of *Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell*, which I also loved, except it was written about 80 years before JSMN \^\^

&amp;#x200B;

# Third Row:

**Self-Published SFF Novel**: Joseph O. Dorah - *The Child of Silence*.

Another one advertised by its writer on r/Fantasy! This book has a very unusual perspective, as it’s told from the point of view of a severely disabled girl. All her family members are powerful magic users, and she’s in a chair, unable to speak or move, useless for them. Her struggles to be seen as a person feel all too realistic, and the pace of the book really works well with that slow progression… I regret some unnecessary lengths (a fight scene in the last part of the book, in particular), but it’s still a very refreshing perspective, so I definitely recommend it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Novel with Chapter Epigraphs**: Brandon Sanderson - *The Way of Kings*.

After reading so much praise on this subreddit, I’ve read a few of Sanderson’s books, but I don’t get it, sorry… The world is original, but I don’t sympathize with any of the characters, and I’m really not a fan of the writing style either. Which shows that I have no taste in books at all. My Sanderson fan friends are extremely disappointed in me, and so am I.

&amp;#x200B;

**&lt;3 Novel Published in 2020**: Martha Wells - *Network Effect*.

The 2020 Murderbot novel is great! I’ve read it twice so far, and I’m probably going to read it again before the next novel is released. In this series, we’re following the adventures of a sarcastic space cyborg who watches too much TV (Murderbot itself), its human friends Dr Mensah et al., and its robotic friends like Asshole Research Transport (ART for short, not its actual name). The world is full of evil corporations doing evil corporation business, but fortunately it’s also full of kind people, human or non-human.

&amp;#x200B;

**Novel Set in a School or University**: John Bierce *- Into the Labyrint*h.

Another one of these books that just doesn’t work for me… I’m very sorry, especially since the author is a member of this subreddit and may stumble across this review (aaaargh). For me, it’s in the same category as Robin Hobb’s or Brandon Sanderson’s books: it’s just not my cup of tea and I don’t know why, but people who appreciate these writers may appreciate the Mage Errant series as well!

&amp;#x200B;

**&lt;3 Book About Books**: Raymond St Elmo - *The Origin of Birds in the Footprints of Writing.*

We’re following the adventures of Clarence St Claire, who has been asked by the NSA to decode what is apparently a bunch of bird tracks. So he does. After a while, the bird tracks start to look suspiciously like words, birds start to look suspiciously like famous writers, and the world itself becomes weirder and weirder (and suspiciously so). I loved that book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys writers like Borges, Calvino or Kafka, as it’s a great tribute to their work (on top of being a great story in itself)!

&amp;#x200B;

# Fourth Row:

**&lt;3 A Book that Made You Laugh**: Becky Chambers - *The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet*.

We’re following the crew of the Wayfarer, a spaceship tasked with punching wormholes through space to make travelling from point A to point B easier for everyone else. There’s a big galactic story happening in the background, and others fight with laser guns in space, but not the crew of the Wayfarer. They’re just people, humans and aliens, trying to do their best to live together, to learn and care about the others, about this unlikely family they are. The characters are great, and their story is beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Five SFF Short Stories**: Jean-Philippe Jaworski - *Le Sentiment du Fer*

A collection of short stories that develop Jaworski’s universe from his novel *Gagner la Guerre*, a mix of Italian Renaissance (with city-states and sword fighters) and traditional fantasy (elves and mysterious magic). The stories offer refreshing versions of fantasy tropes, often with lots of precise technical words, but they’re also surprisingly haunting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Big Dumb Object**: James S; A. Corey - *Leviatan Wakes*

I love the TV series *The Expanse* and read the books to see how similar or different they were… as it turns out, the answer is “very similar”. The problem is, some of the things that feel new and modern in sci-fi shows (from the Belters themselves to the fact that the heroes run simulations to train before a fight in space, all the elements that make that world realistic) are actually much older tropes in written sci-fi, and the universe feels less exciting as a book… which doesn’t mean that it’s a bad story at all, just less exciting.

&amp;#x200B;

**&lt;3 Feminist Novel**: M. L. Wang – *The Sword of Kaigen*

One of the many great books I wouldn’t have discovered without this subreddit. In a Japan-inspired village, we follow the young Mamoru, a promising fighter, and his mother Misaki, a former superhero (kind of) and now passive housewife in a rigid patriarchal society, as they’re dragged into a violent conflict. The story is dark and character-focused – and the characters are great, with their doubts and contradictions and slow or sudden evolutions… It’s a beautiful, heartbreaking book. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Novel by a Canadian Author**: Steven Erikson - *Midnight Tides*

(re-read) The *Malazan Book of the Fallen* is amazing, with all its complex characters and rich history. This novel is one of my favourite books in the series, I love the contrast between the nonsensical humour and critique of capitalism and the heavy pathos surrounding some characters. One moment I’m laughing to tears, and the next one Erikson breaks my heart using only a few words.

However, the whole “haha rape is fun if the victim is mentally handicapped and well hung” subplot was really not great. I still liked the book as a whole, but, well. Not a fan of that part.

&amp;#x200B;

# Fifth Row

**Novel with a Number in the Title**: C. R. Smith - *Two Thousand Leagues as the Seabird*.

Khatan tells the story of his life, as a pariah, a mercenary fighter, a servant… It’s a reflection on his violent life, his failures and regrets. The prose is poetic and contemplative, and gives a nice rhythm to the story. I really enjoyed the different settings explored as well, the vast steppes and frozen North.

&amp;#x200B;

**Romantic Fantasy / Paranormal Romance**: A. K. Caggiano - *The Korinniad*.

The yearly virgin sacrifice approaches, and Korinna is likely going to be the next victim. But she’d rather not die, so she prays the goddess Aphrodite to send her someone – not her true love, just someone to have sex with to avoid being sacrificed. I picked this book after the writer specifically advertised it as a way to fill the “romance” square of the bingo card :) I love the writer’s sense of humour, and even though you kind of know from the beginning how it’s going to end, the journey is fun and enjoyable, with cute monsters and ridiculous gods!

&amp;#x200B;

**Novel with a Magical Pet**: Will Wight – *Ghostwater*

These books feel a bit like an idle game, with the protagonist growing exponentially powerful, and you’re just here to watch him become stronger and stronger. On one hand, it’s not my cup of tea; on the other hand, I got the first books when they were available for free, started reading, and immediately bought the others to read them all in less than two weeks. It’s extremely addictive. The characters are not especially likeable, I just want to watch them become stronger… which is a weird feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

**&lt;3 Format: Graphic Novel (at least 1 vol.) OR Audiobook / Audio drama**: Ashley Cope – *Unsounded*.

The bestest online comic ever. We follow the adventures of Duane Adelier (badass mage, great with kids, zombie, and pious believer in a religion which abhors zombies), Sette Frummagen (young girl who’s not entirely human, best thief in the world according to herself), and dozens of other likeable characters. Most of these characters are deeply flawed and very human (including the non-human ones), with so much love and racism and kindness and suffering. They’re not all on the same side, and most of them try to do what’s right, they just don’t have the same values and perspective... It’s a beautiful and heartbreaking story, and the author’s drawing style is amazing too!

&amp;#x200B;

**Novel Featuring Politics**: K. J. Parker - *The Folding Knife*

In this book, we follow the rise to power and inevitable fall of a Machiavellian banker and politician. We know from the beginning how he’s going to end, and we watch all his smart calculations and complex plans unfold, knowing that at some point his life will be destroyed. It’s a gripping story, and it works very well."
234,Fantasy,A Review of Mercedes Lackey's Arrows Trilogy,"Here I will be talking about ARROWS OF THE QUEEN, ARROWS FLIGHT and ARROWS FALL.

This series centers around a girl named Talia and follows her from youth to adulthood, at the beginning of the novel she flees from her village due to being chosen by her companion, Rolan. 

The first book, Arrows of the Queen was my favorite of this series. In this one you learn about what Heralds are and how the magic system works. 

It also is the most wholesome as the adults feel like adults, they do their best to comfort Talia whenever she is feeling down and its clear they care deeply about all of their students. Rating is nine out of ten

The second book, ARROWS FLIGHT was not a bad book by any means, but I didn't like it as much as the first one and I didn't like it as much as book three. 

This book has Talia, her companions and another one of her friends trapped in one spot for most of the book, she has help trying to get her ability under control and this other character helps her.

 The pacing is VERY slow, though. Its also a bit darker, not grimdark but not as bright and cheery as book one although even that book had one or two moments that were very dark. I would give it a six out of ten.

ARROWS FALL is the third book and the one I am the most lukewarm about. Maybe because the ending didn't feel like a complete ending, and it isn't a complete ending as there is a few more books later down the road in this world that resume this storyline. 

This is definitely the darkest though, the ending has some scenes that are Very mature. And although the true ending of this third book ends with a happy ending, there is still a lot of tension that has not been resolved yet. 

This book felt more like a traditional fantasy book, it has a set beginning and middle and end whereas the first two felt like a very long beginning. We learn more about this world, but not everything, which is a good strategy as it made me want to learn more about this world and its history. I would give it an 8 out of ten.

This series felt like one long fantasy book, one long storyline that allows it to be easy to follow, if memory serves me right tues were once adult fantasy books but then they were advertised as Young Adult books. They felt significantly more mature then a modern YA fantasy novel, not as mature as something like ASOIAF and WOT but still mature. 

I like this series a lot and highly recommend it, even if you are used to reading more modern and mature fantasy, Theres still something in this series for you to enjoy."

236,Fantasy,Book recommendations,I was wondering what your suggestions are for some grim dark themes but more like grim dark-lite.  I think it’s a little difficult to describe but I feel like the Witcher series was less grim dark more “realistic” in the sense that the people in the books act like how people would actually act.
237,Fantasy,Messianic fantasy recs,"Yo.

I'm looking for a particular flavour of the chosen one trope we all love or love to hate - proper messianic fantasy.

This with the feeling of a preordained chosen one, or the favoured child of destiny, coupled with bits of mysticism and faith or philosophy.

I'm talking the likes of Rand al'Thor or Luke Skywalker, particularly along the bent of zen Rand from the later books.

I would appreciate any recs for something which even loosely fits the bill. Any form of media really, though novels preferred."
238,Fantasy,A Southeast Asian's Review of Raya and the Last Dragon,[removed]
239,Fantasy,Gardens of the Moon isn't that confusing/hard to follow (no spoilers),"Just finished book 1 of Malazan, and perhaps the fact that I went straight into it after finishing The Dark Tower helped, but I didn't find it hugely confusing or difficult to follow at all.

Yes it lacks depth, and yes it does indeed throw you into the middle of a story full of lots of different characters (not anywhere near as many as people make out - I had no problem following who was who even if they disappeared for a while in the book). And yes there are several characters/places/concepts mentioned that I am still unclear about as they're as yet not fully explained.

But on the whole it really isn't that difficult to work out what's going on. In fact, the story is just one intrigue/mystery after another and its truly epic and great.

The sole reason for this thread is that I see so many warnings from people about how it's incredibly difficult to read this book and follow what's going on. I think that's only the case if you're either not paying attention or leaving huge gaps of time between every time you pick up the book.

The one argument I can sort of understand is that people find it hard to care for certain characters even a half or 3/4 into the book - fair enough, it's true that for some Steven Erikson really doesn't provide much background at all and you're left to follow their activities as they happen in the book to determine if you even like them or not. 

Strongly recommend this one to anyone who isn't sure."
240,Fantasy,Potentially Unpopular Opinion: Sanderson's world building is exhausting,"I'm going to preface this by saying that the Stormlight Archive quickly rose to be one of my favorite fantasy series ever. The characters, the action, the massive swords and cool fantasy-power armor... I loved it all. But now I'm about halfway through Rhythm of War, and I can't help but feel extremely fatigued reading it. As someone who's read the Wheel of Time, ASOIAF, and partway through Malazan, I'm no stranger to huge overarching worlds and plotlines, and oftentimes I really love it. 

But now I just feel exhausted. 

I almost long for a more, down to earth, simple 'classic' fantasy adventure again. I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on a large portion of what the Stormlight Archive provides since I wasn't a big fan of Mistborn and haven't become on expert on the Cosmere as a whole. I feel like so much of the book is dependent on the ready understanding countless obscure references and a deep knowledge of the entire Cosmere, otherwise large amounts of detail and plot points are completely missed. I wonder if anyone else feels like Sanderson has too many Chekhov's Guns that just haven't been addressed and keep throwing more on the plate of the reader.  Do you guys think that the new trend in modern fantasy is authors just trying to reinvent the wheel and potentially lose sight of what makes fantasy appealing? 

If this kind of post sounds ridiculous or doesn't belong here, downvote away and I'll reconsider my current attitude to his worldbuilding."

242,Fantasy,[OC][Artist] - Armored Lady - Commision Open,
243,Fantasy,Kitiara and Raistlin have the greatest sibling rivalry in fantasy history.,"A million sibling rivalries exist in the fantasy genre, and they’re really interesting based on a lot of different things like backstories, magic powers, inspirations, etc.

Other sibling rivalries might have more interesting backstories, but Kitiara and Raistlin take the cake in how absurd both of the characters are.

Kitiara turned against the companions, and she still has a weird thing with Tanis Half-Elven.

On the other hand, Raistlin is basically an emo teenager having too much fun doing magic, and instead of kicking him out, the companions have no choice but to rely on him because he’s their only mage.

For Kitiara to be on the side of Takhisis and for Raistlin to be one of the companions is such a bizarre opposite duo. You have one weirdo on one side and the sibling weirdo on the other.

It’s especially interesting because, as we learn, Raistlin isn’t the most loyal companion. I don’t want to spoil anything, but you shouldn’t always expect him to be honest. His disloyalty isn’t even a hamartia that he can’t control, like Tanis’s attachment to Kitiara. Raistlin’s disloyalty will make your head spin, like “what the fuck!! You parasitic prick.”

I think it’s hilarious."

*“I see you in the light of the water, in the swaying of the young trees in the spring wind. I see you in the shadows of the great oaks, I hear your voice in the cry of the owl at night.”*

**So What’s It About**?

*""Lovely Sorcha is the seventh child and only daughter of Lord Colum of Sevenwaters. Bereft of a mother, she is comforted by her six brothers who love and protect her. Sorcha is the light in their lives: they are determined that she know only contentment.*

*But Sorcha’s joy is shattered when her father is bewitched by his new wife, an evil enchantress who binds her brothers with a terrible spell, a spell which only Sorcha can lift—by staying silent. If she speaks before she completes the quest set to her by the Fair Folk and their queen, the Lady of the Forest, she will lose her brothers forever.*

*When Sorcha is kidnapped by the enemies of Sevenwaters and taken to a foreign land, she is torn between the desire to save her beloved brothers, and a love that comes only once. Sorcha despairs at ever being able to complete her task, but the magic of the Fair Folk knows no boundaries, and love is the strongest magic of them all…""*

Major spoilers and the discussion of an underage person being sexually assaulted follow.

**What I Thought**

Two years ago I read *Heart’s Blood* and it made me sob, then last year I read *Dreamer’s Pool* and it also made me sob, and now I’ve read *Daughter of the Forest* and…well, shockingly, it left me a giant mess of emotions, crying away. I haven’t read a book where the main character faces such a nearly-incessant barrage of suffering since I finished Robin Hobb’s several series about Fitz. Combine the constant onslaught of suffering with some Grade A Yearning in one of Marillier’s trademark swoony romances and you’ve got yourself an emotional sucker punch of a book.

I think the closest thing I’ve read to *Daughter of the Forest* would be *Deerskin* by Robin McKinley – both books are lush and beautiful and sorrowful, fairy tale-based and largely focused on the young protagonist’s recovery after her world is shattered by being raped. The romance plays a much bigger role in this book than *Deerskin,* while in *Deerskin* the central relationship is between the protagonist and her dog, but I do think both are fairly excellent portrayals of survival through trauma. I wrote a post on r/fantasy a while ago about [how I feel about Deerskin and how much it means to me as someone who has experienced sexual assault](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/i58tyc/thinking_about_different_kinds_of_darkness/), and this is now another story that I can add to my collection of books that mean so, so much to me because of how they handle this topic. 

Sorcha is an incredibly strong character, and as I desperately wanted to see her be okay it was a joy to watch each little triumph as she started to heal, trust and save her brothers and herself over the course of the book. Her struggle is harrowing and well-written and you truly understand the extent of her devastation and fear, while a few aspects of her story particularly stand out to me. While there are symptoms like nightmares and flashbacks you really get to see how being raped has entirely altered the way that she fundamentally sees the world. Her cognitive distortions about men are particularly interesting to me, like the way she believes that Red is only kind to her because the fae have compelled him to protect her.

As far as the actual rape scene itself goes, my initial response was that it was really (and possibly unnecessarily) graphic. I posted asking about what people thought about this on Goodreads and got some really interesting and helpful responses. What I realized is that everyone has a different line in the sand as far as what feels like too much for them, and that's totally okay…and while sexual assault is often used in an unnecessary and gratuitous way in fantasy stories, I don’t think it is necessarily gratuitous to show the horror of what it’s like in someone’s head while they are being assaulted if the point of the story is to explore the experience of sexual assault and its aftermath in a meaningful way. In my opinion *Daughter of the Forest* does this effectively.

I will say, however, that one of the most popular reviews on Goodreads pointed out that the consensual sex scene in the book is not as explicit as the assault scene, and the reviewer wished this had been different. I don't know if this is something that I would have noticed on my own, but I think it's an interesting point to make. I am not necessarily saying “I want Juliet Marillier to write explicit sex scenes”… but I’m NOT not saying that, either. We get to live in Sorcha’s head throughout the time she is being assaulted so why can’t we be in her head while she’s having a frankly excellent time of it? Instead it’s just like, Red checks for consent, I have a flashback and he comforts me, and then *my body opens for him like a flower* (shudder). I don't know if I feel as strongly about this as the reviewer on Goodreads (who, coincidentally, loved everything else about the book just like I did!) but it gave me something to think about. 

It’s easy, in a story about rape and sexism, to write of men altogether, and I really appreciate Marillier’s approach of regularly showing them in their goodness and complexity as human beings too. I love Red with his gentle nature, his deep thoughtfulness and his dedication to Sorcha through all their trials. Marillier’s romances are really something else -they’re the perfect amount of fraught yearning and sweetness and emotional intelligence and kind but broken people coming together and supporting one another. My favorite scene in the book is when they spend the day at the beach, and just thinking about it now puts a lump in my throat. Sometimes, when I'm reading a romance that really hits home for me, I get so emotionally overwhelmed that I have to take breaks and distract myself to handle the emotions, so I spent a large part of the book's ending reading a few pages and then pausing to scroll through Tumblr. 

The only Thing about this story is that Sorcha is sixteen at the end when she marries Red, while he’s in his early twenties. Okay, YES, it’s set in ancient times when the age of consent wasn’t a thing and she’s being historically accurate! I know that! I know and respect that others may feel differently but my take on this is that you kind of have to balance historical accuracy with the values of the present day reader and how they’re going to respond to the story. As much as I absolutely adored the romance, it just feels like a weird component of teenage Sorcha’s healing journey to fall in love with an adult man while everyone keeps talking about how young and tiny she is.

Richard is a despicable villain, and I almost wish there was something redeemable or nuanced about him because he is more or less entirely horrible, while I love the depth and complexity of Sorcha’s relationship with all of her brothers. It rings so true that they are so controlling and protective of her after she saves them and turns them back into humans, because they still see her as a child in their minds and they can’t truly understand how much she has grown and suffered to end their curse. It’s also remarkable that each of the six manages to have such a distinct voice and personality.

*Daughter of the Forest* is also beautifully-written and indescribably atmospheric. You truly feel transported to the ancient Irish forest and its magical, fae secrets; you truly feel the sorrow and suffering (and more suffering, and just a little more suffering) as well as the sweetness and joy. Every one of Marillier’s books that I’ve read has been evocative in this way, and I think she’s a true master of this kind of descriptive and emotional writing. The ending is also absolutely perfect in my opinion, as her brothers gradually depart to live the lives they were denied for so long. I wouldn’t say that this is a read for the faint heart, but it’s so very worth it. I’ll be building up my emotional reserves again, and I’ll be back to sobbing over another Juliet Marillier book soon enough."

It’s that time of year again, where r/fantasy bingo is almost at an  end and it’s time to write mini-reviews of all the books I chose to fill  the squares. 

I also drew quick Bad Fan Art sketches to accompany all these, but it would've made the Reddit post too crowded so I decided to leave them out, if you want to see them they are on the full blog post [here](http://thedragonscribe.com/2021/03/09/r-fantasy-bingo-wrap-up-row-1/)!

So, without further ado!

**Novel Translated from its Original Language**

### Beowulf by Maria Davhana Headley

**Hard Mode**: Translated by a woman; original author is unknown, but definitely wanted you to know how manly they were

This is not your high school English class’s Beowulf! Headley’s new  translation got a lot of well-deserved attention last year for its  colloquial tone and use of the word “bro.” This is Beowulf as it was  most-likely intended to be enjoyed by its original audience: spoken out  loud a conversational, yet bombastic tone, preferably among friends with  a large mug of ale. The pandemic has made being among friends with a  large mug of ale prohibitively dangerous for many, but if you listen to  the audiobook, you can still get part of the experience. The best part  of this translation was how accessible and relatable it was. Beowulf is  an exploration of masculinity, toxic and otherwise, bro culture, and  what it means to grow older and wonder if you’ve still “got it.”

## Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold

### Mercurial by Naomi Hughes

**Hard Mode:** They’re only stranded in the cold for part of the book, but there I believe they spend the whole time in the cold setting

This was an emotional and heartrending story about love, redemption,  forgiveness, and the tricky question of whether there is a line that is  too far to cross where one can no longer be redeemed. Although  frustrating at time, I came to care deeply for all of the main  characters, even as they drove me out of my mind. And there are sled  dogs. Everyone loves sled dogs! The main characters spend a large part  of the book working together to try and survive in the wilderness in a  blizzard, which made it an ideal candidate for this square. I wrote a  full review of this one, which you can read [here](http://thedragonscribe.com/2021/03/07/mercurial-by-naomi-hughes/).

## Optimistic Spec Fic

### The Heretic’s Guide to Homecoming by Sienna Tristen

**Hard Mode:** Unless Sienna Tristen is a super secret pen name for Becky Chambers, yes

This was an early contender for one of my top reads of 2020. I read  it pretty early during the bingo cycle, so it almost feels kind of funny  writing about it now. April 2020, was I ever really that young? But I  digress. Heretic’s Guide is the story of Ronoah, a tightly-wound ball of  anxiety in human form. When a mysterious and powerful figure invites  Ronoah to journey with him, he is of course excited for the adventure,  but he also continually gets in his own way. This isn’t the book for you  if you’re looking for fast paced action and adventure, and I fully  understand that spending all this time in Ronoah’s head can be A Lot for  some people. But the book is beautifully written, too, and I really  appreciated how it showed Ronoah’s growth and the incremental  improvement of his life, without making his anxiety magically disappear  overnight.

## Novel Featuring Necromancy

### Black Stone Heart by Michael R Fletcher

**Hard Mode:** Alas, no, the main character is a demonologist, one of his romantic interests is the necromancer

This one is tricky to review because it has the simultaneous  distinction of being really masterfully written and also unfortunately,  100% very much Not My Thing. Like Mercurial, reviewed above, this book  explores the question of whether amnesia can be a tool for redemption.  This one, alas, takes a pretty pessimistic view of the whole thing.  While Khraen whinges a lot about how he wants to be a better man, he  puts very little action towards becoming one. I believe [the Fantasy Inn’s Hiu](https://thefantasyinn.com/2021/02/26/black-stone-heart-by-michael-r-fletcher-spfbo/)  best summed up my feelings: this doesn’t so much ask the question as to  whether it’s okay to commit atrocities for the greater good, but  rather, “Is it okay to kill a bunch of people if you’re really, *really*  horny?” Black Stone Heart reads like it was written by an edgy 15 year  old who also happens to be a literary genius. The prose and pacing in  this book were excellent and I found myself engaged the whole time.  Unfortunately, it was way too grimdark for my tastes. Fans of the  grimdark subgenre will likely enjoy this one, however.

## Ace/Aro Spec Fic

### Deathless Divide by Justina Ireland

**Hard Mode**: Yes, one of the two main POV characters is aroace

Deathless Divide is the second entry in Justina Ireland’s young adult  series about young Black women fighting zombies in Post-Civil-War  America. It picks up right where the first book left off, and makes it  obvious from the get-go that Katherine and Jane’s problems are far from  over. I thought I had a pretty good idea where this book was going to go  based on the setup from the previous book, but it turns out I was dead  wrong. Undead wrong. Justina Ireland took my expectations and set them  on fire — in a good way. This book was a lot more brutal than the first  one, which wasn’t exactly a cake walk to begin with. The body count in  book two is staggering, including many named characters who I would have  wrongly assumed were “safe.” I enjoyed seeing Katherine introduced as a  POV character, promoted from being a side character in book one. We  even get an explanation as to why she likes wearing corsets so much —  and no, it’s not just because she is fashionable. I really enjoyed both  of the main characters in this, and I hope that Ireland writes more in  this universe.

However, I also 'read' almost entirely through audiobooks. So I'm curious - **what are some of your favorite books authored by POC/Women that also happen to have outstanding narration** (hopefully also by women/POC, but don't have to be)?

265,Fantasy,Need help finding a book,"Hey people,

A couple of years ago (I think a decade?) I read the first book of a series. As I was too young and didn't really understand the story I didn't continue reading, but now I'd like to retry the series as it somehow left an impression on me. Only problem is I don't know the name of the series/book, so I hope you guys might help me :)

The things I remember from the book:

-There were multiple POVs. 

-One POV was about a female demon in another dimension that was gathering an army. 

-Another POV was about a band of traveling people. I remember 2 mages that were from differens ""schools of magic"" and didn't like each other because of that, but ended up sleeping together (I think the female mage was pregnant by the end of the book).

-The male mage had his own demon and was bound to it. If the demon got hurt, the mage felt it's pain (and vice versa). 

-I remember a POV of a mercenary man that traveled with the mages and died at the end of the first book. When he was buried, a couple of angels/demons came to take his body/soul (can't quite remember).

-I remember a scene where hundreds of mages used water as a weapon of mass destruction by opening a portal the a sea in another dimension and a flooding the water into a narrow pass where the enemy army was stationed. 

Somehow I can't get my mind of this story, it had a lot of interesting ideas and concepts that I didn't appreciate at the time. Really hope someone can help me :)

Thanks!"

**The Master of Whitestorm** \- My husband thoroughly enjoyed this when it first came out and we have the original print editions!  


**Sorcerer's Legacy** \- One of my favourite fantasy books full stop. A unique take on portal fantasy, combined with romance, grief, and painful decisions. I was sobbing in a dental office reading this. A beautiful, breathtaking book.

**The Cycle of Fire trilogy** \- I've not read this one yet, but my husband said it was his favourite of all of Janny's works. (You can purchase the individual titles, or the complete box set -- the compete set is significantly cheaper than the individual books right now, so you might want to grab that while you can at the price)

267,Fantasy,Favorite Takes on Mythology,"Mythology is everywhere in fantasy, whether it's featured directly in urban fantasy or used as inspiration for creatures, characters, or story arcs in the wider genre. What are your favorite uses of mythology? Most creative? Best use of lesser-known myths? Anything's fair game. 

Recently, I loved Rebecca Roanhorse's *Trail of Lightning*, a post-apocalyptic fantasy suffused with Navajo mythology, which was a refreshing example of an underrepresented tradition. On the other end of things completely, the video game *Hades* had a wonderful take on Greek myth that was at once warm and familiar and boldly doing its own thing. The wildly dysfunctional Olympians and the lovable chthonic gods were simply excellent. And you can pet the (three-headed) dog. I love anything that features the Furies (in case my first novel didn't give that away), and it was great to see them get some of the attention they deserve."
268,Fantasy,Which fantasy authors give hardly (and I say hardly because I think it’s impossible to give none at all) plot armor to their characters?,"Please **no spoilers** just an author or book series that does this is enough. You don’t have to say who it is specifically that dies or gets disfigured/disabled. I looking for my next series where I feel like no one is safe and characters have very little plot armor.. not just that but I want to feel like the story is unfolding in a natural way. I don’t want to feel like I’m reading something that’s been “wrote” if you know what I mean .. if a character(s) get stuck in a deathly situation it normally results in death or disfigurement 
Not someone coming swooping down on their horse to save them .. 

Basically which author or series do some of the main players get shockingly murdered/disabled/disfigured  out of no where? Not protagonist that just seemed to be there only to die but characters you truly thought would stay with the reader throughout the series?"

# The Grotesques by Tia Reed

&gt;Discredited journalist Ella Jerome isn’t thrilled about working at Adelaide’s fanciful tabloid the Informer. So when zoologist Adam Lowell seeks her help in finding his missing cousin, she’s cynical of his claim a monster lurks near the Church of the Resurrection. The trouble is, solving the gruesome case could be her best shot at restoring her reputation.  
&gt;  
&gt;With her old instincts resurfacing, Ella combs the Port for clues. Experience tells her the only monsters are the human variety, and the bloodied stonemason certainly raises her suspicions. But when her investigation turns up everything from petrified remains to the headless carving of a dragon, the truth threatens to steal both her sanity and the man she’s falling for.  
&gt;  
&gt;After all, gargoyles can’t be anything other than harmless stone. Or can they?

&gt;  
&gt;The complete Nearspace Trilogy, a space opera about family . . . and secrets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Book 1: One’s Aspect to the Sun -- It’s proving to be no small task to track down Luta’s geneticist mother in the vast, wormhole-ridden expanse of Nearspace. With the ruthless PrimeCorp bent on obtaining Luta’s DNA at any cost, her ninety-year-old husband asking for one last favor, and her estranged daughter locking horns with her at every turn, Luta’s search for answers will take her to the furthest reaches of space–and deep inside her own heart.  
&gt;  
&gt;Book 2: Dark Beneath the Moon -- When a mysterious attack leaves them stranded in an uncharted new system, Luta, her crew, and Jahelia Sord, a woman on her own mission, must try to put their differences aside and decide who to trust, while they uncover a shocking truth about the Chron war and what their old enemies are so afraid of . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;Book 3: Beyond the Sentinel Stars -- Luta’s old enemy Alin Sedmamin is back—and asking Luta to help save his life. In exchange, Sedmamin is offering secrets stretching back more than a century into Nearspace’s past—secrets that could prevent a war.

# Hollow by Rhonda Parrish

Now her brother’s dead, her mom's paralyzed in more ways than one, her dad lives at work and her seven-year-old sister Amy tries too freaking hard to salvage everything. What’s more, high school is its own special kind of hell, where her ex-boyfriend delights in spreading rumors that shred her reputation and make her feel like a loser.   
&gt;  
&gt;When she finds an old camera in a creepy abandoned hospital, it seems like her luck is finally changing. And it is changing--from bad to worse. Because of course it is. Each time Morgan photographs one of her classmates they become corrupted versions of themselves. It's like the camera steals their goodness, their essence, and leaves them hollow.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then her sister uses the camera to take a selfie.  
&gt;  
&gt;No matter what the cost, Morgan will find a way to reverse the effects of the cursed camera and save Amy, before her already-fractured family completely self-destructs.

#  Marie Jenner Mysteries Volumes 1 - 3 by E. C. Bell

&gt;*Marie wants a normal job—a normal life. She isn’t going to get it.*  
&gt;  
&gt;This omnibus includes the first three novels of the Marie Jenner Mystery series:  
&gt;  
&gt;**SEEING THE LIGHT (Book 1):** When Marie applies for the job of her dreams, her wished-for normal life doesn’t magically begin. Well, not entirely. She does get the job — but she also gets a ghost. Farley Hewitt, the newly dead caretaker of the building, wants her to prove his death is not an accident, and she’s pretty sure he’s going to haunt her until she does.  
&gt;  
&gt;**DROWNING IN AMBER (Book 2):** Amateur sleuth Marie Jenner tries—one more time with feeling—to pull her life together. She takes the case of Honoria Lowe, a woman of interest in Eddie Hansen's gruesome murder. But despite knowing where he died, Marie can’t find Eddie’s ghost. There’s never a ghost around when you want one.  
&gt;  
&gt;**STALKING THE DEAD (Book 3):** When Marie’s slightly-more-than-boss, James Lavall, decides to visit her mother, she follows him. But the Jenner family reunion is ruined when Marie’s ex-boyfriend winds up dead…and James is the prime suspect.

# Helix: Three Novels by Pat Flewwelling

&gt;Perfected by nature. Twisted by science. A miracle cure gone very, very wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;The complete Helix Trilogy, a tense science-fiction thriller series about Ishmael, businessman, agent of the Wyrd Council … and a shapeshifter.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Book 1: Blight of Exiles -- An abandoned forest resort should have been paradise for a creature like Ishmael. Isolated from civilization, so far removed from human eyes, Ishmael could have reveled in his true nature without threat of discovery. In this unholy quarantine, Ishmael is just another mouth to feed. And he’s no longer the apex predator.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Book 2: Plague of Ghouls -- Because of his crimes, his breach of quarantine, and his new and worrisome symptoms, Ishmael and his rescued Pack are pariahs among werewolves, loathed, and under constant suspicion. And yet, when bodies turn up in small-town Ontario, the Wyrd Council splits up Ishmael’s Pack and sends him to investigate. He’s hurried away from the safety and isolation of Varco Lake, and thrust into an anxious, tightly-knit community full of surveillance cameras, cell phones, and bad memories.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Book 3: Scourge of Bones -- Ishmael's few allies have taken shelter in a bunker in Halifax, waiting for him to recover, waiting for him to choose a course of direction. Half a continent away, a panic-stricken town is under military-enforced quarantine, and the situation is about to become violent, and viral. When the Pack decides to bring the fight to Jay and his Bone Tribe, they're halted by a new player in the game.

# The Witch's Diary by Rebecca Brae

 

&gt;*The higher you fly, the farther you fall. And I’d be surprised if the grubs in the Ascariim deep mine didn’t hear my splat.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Hester Wishbone has it made. A recent graduate of Grimoire College, she has a great job as a village hag and is eagerly awaiting the arrival of her familiar. She is also well on the way to earning her Adept Witch designation.  
&gt;  
&gt;But her perfect life starts to unravel. After an unfortunate incident involving a flammable prosthetic nose, Hester loses her job. Her assigned familiar turns out to be a cockroach. And her magick seems to be well and truly gone.  
&gt;  
&gt;With time running out on her Adept qualification period, Hester embarks on an epic job search. Her quest takes her to sticky gingerbread houses, dank bogs, and even the dreaded Outerplane (which is a Level 7 Magick Null Zone). Through it all, Hester must figure out what kind of witch she is, if she has no magick.

271,Fantasy,The book crave by Tracy Wolff (readers please help me!!),"Hi, so I just bought the book crave by Tracy Wolff from Amazon because it’s wayyy cheaper than Barnes and noble but when it arrived I noticed that the last page of the book is on 572 pg. I thought the book had 592 pg. So can anyway tell me if this is correct??"
272,Fantasy,Books Where Mothers Fight for Their Children,"They don't have to be the biological mother of the child/children in question, but I'm looking for fantasy books where moms or mother-figures raise hell on behalf of their children - to stop them being hurt, to rescue them, anything. Cordelia from the Vorkosigan saga or Essun from the Broken Earth trilogy are both great examples! 

I don't mind whether we're talking warrior-queen moms or house wives, I just want to see mothers going above and beyond for their kids.

I'd prefer books where the mother-character is the *main* character, but I'll accept stories where she's a secondary character as well. ***But I'm not absolutely not interested in stories where moms die!*** If there's a dead mother in the backstory and the book focuses on the stepmom/adopted mother/mother figure, that's okay, but don't rec me something where the 'raising hell' ends with the mother dying, please! 

(Also just looking for great moms in general, so if you know any books with supportive/awesome moms I'll take those too, even if the moms don't do any hell-raising!)

Any suggestions?"
273,Fantasy,"The first two books in my dark/low fantasy werewolf series, The Lycanthrope Saga, are free for Kindle until Friday","I'll just start this by saying I've been a fairly regular commenter/poster in here since discovering r/fantasy a couple of months ago, and I don't believe I've ever self-promo'd in any way. Judging by the rules, this one post seems allowed, but if not - well, mods, feel free to get rid of it and give me a stern telling off!

The first two books in The Lycanthrope Saga, my fully-planned six book dark/low fantasy series, are free until the end of Friday on Amazon in ebook format. I've been writing this series since 2017, with Birthing the Beast self-published in 2019 and Monsters and Men self-published in late 2020. It's very low fantasy (no magic), focusing more on building a gritty and realistic world in the early days of the ""Age of Industry"", with the titular creatures re-emerging in a land that no longer even remembers they exist. I won't give too much away, but I basically wanted to build a fictional world and story where werewolves are as I've always wanted to read them myself; huge, bloodthirsty, terrifying, and all by unstoppable in a fantasy setting as opposed to a pure horror one. Imagine Van Helsing (2004) meets ASOIAF (not that I think I'm *that* good of an author haha, but that's what I was somewhat going for with my influences).

Basically, I'm immensely passionate about the world and story that I've been living in and writing for the last few years, and I'm keen to spread it to the masses who love this genre as much as I do. Without further ado, I'll include the links below for a free download. I hope those of you who give it a download enjoy the read, and feedback is always more than welcome!

Thank you! Here is the blurb to the first book, in case anyone wants an idea of the what the style, setting and general atmosphere of this series is:

*""A carpenter’s son, weighed down by a tragic family history. A Chief of Law, haunted by a dark and shameful past. A farmer’s daughter, rebellious and tired of a sheltered life. And an ancient evil emerging from the depths of the forest, bringing forth the greatest threat to man since the dawn of time…*

*Felltree Island has always been a quiet and peaceful place, far removed from the Kingdom of Estherland across the Gracious Sea. But, on this once quiet island where farmers and fishermen take pride in their simple lives beyond the reach of the spreading Age of Industry, something stirs in the shadows - something that will leave the people of Felltree Island with no choice but to face a dark force long forgotten by civilised man.*

*The days are growing colder. The nights are growing longer. A full moon is rising...*  
*Prepare to witness the birthing of the beast.*

*In the first part of The Lycanthrope Saga, dark fantasy and horror collide to form a tale of terror, loyalty, endurance, bravery in the face of evil, and the importance of facing your demons before they tear you apart.""*"

278,Fantasy,Author Appreciation part 3: Patricia McKillip,"Why you should read Patricia McKillip

I hear all of you saying but I have read McKillip. I read the Forgotten Beasts of Eld it's a classic. And of course you are right. 

1. She has a lot more to offer than the work she's most famous for

 But what if I told you that Forgotten Beasts of Eld was only the third book she ever published and her first novel (the first two being children's books) and she has written more than 30 novels since then? If you loved The Forgotten Beasts of Eld imagine how much you'll love her more recent work where she has had three decades to get better at prose, and story telling. The Forgotten Beast of Eld is good but her newer works really show that she still had room to grow as an author. 

2. Her prose is on point

She builds the most beautiful worlds full of magic around every corner. From new magical animals, to hidden magic schools, forgotten languages, and magic patterns. Her worlds are breathtaking and easy to imagine. The characters feel real. They all have different hopes and dreams, different backgrounds and histories. She also writes some of the best love stories and some of the most heartbreaking. She shows not just the love between partners but between friends and family too. 

3. They are modern fairytales

While recently re-tellings and re-interpritations have been popular (not that they ever went out of style) such as Spinning Silver or The Bear and the Nightingale Mckillips stories are fully original. And yet they contain the touch points of fantasy familiar pieces to orient yourself around in the new worlds she creates. But always in a new way. A wonderful combination of both following and greaking the rules of high fantasy.

4. Strong women

Strong women all over the place and in all different types. Strong warrior women, strong researchers, strong mermaids, and witches and sorceresses. Young women, and older women she even talks about how when she tries to writes stories about men they still end up being about women. But that is not to say the men get short shrift. She writes men as well as women and all types of men as well. 

5. I'm not the only one who thinks she is great

Patricia A Mckillip has won The World Fantasy Award, a Locust award, two Mythopoeic awards and in 2008 Won the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement. 

&amp;#x200B;

So even if you've already read The Forgotten Beasts of Eld maybe it is time you give this author another chance! Don't have time for a Novel? She has a bunch of short stories available too. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. Bonus they make your book shelves look pretty.

The credit for this of course goes of course to her cover artist Kinuko Craft but just look at some of these covers and tell me you don't want that on your shelf!

&amp;#x200B;

[This one is my favorite of her books!](https://preview.redd.it/1s9ce38ufzl61.png?width=184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed356a87b7c3328bf40210fcc6020f43a74e8dac)

279,Fantasy,Fantasy-adjacent stories?,"Does anyone particularly like stories that are technically in the fantasy genre but are definitely not the first thing that comes to mind when fantasy is discussed? 

Stories that take place in the real world and have no magic in the fantastical sense can still be considered fantasy. The Goosebumps books were some of my favorites when I was a kid, but it kind of toes the line of what’s considered “a fantasy book”. 

I’d also consider Zootopia and Robin Hood— and other movies with anthropomorphic characters— to all be in the fantasy genre. But I lot of them done have (or need) magical elements to be great works of fantasy.  

Does anyone else know of any fantasy-adjacent stuff that really appealed to them? What else would people consider “fantasy-adjacent”? Or do people just think that all fantasy is fantasy?"
280,Fantasy,Are there any works that portray/depict Latin American cultures in a further era than they were in history?,"Typically whenever I see Latin American culture in fantasy or fiction, it's always where they were in our own history, and never what they might've been able to become had they been able to keep up with the eras most of the world was able to achieve. Either that, or we see them as lizard people. As a Hispanic person myself, I'd love to find some works that try and improve and interpret our cultures to a more fitting era for the universes they're put into. I'm curious, are there any works out there, be it movies, books, games, that try and come up with a way to portray these cultures in the later eras that most of the rest of fantasy usually derives from?"
281,Fantasy,Short fantasy recommendations,I love a good long fantasy but I recently had a baby so I now have a lot less free time to read and I've been struggling a bit with longer books since I don't have as much time to really sink into a new world so was wondering if anyone has any recommendation for shorter fantasy books? I'm thinking around or under 400 pages and don't mind if it's part of a series.

284,Fantasy,Help discerning if this is Dark or Edgy,"I am currently working on a fantasy novel and there is a scene I want to add to establish some of the darker parts of this worlds lore. The problem is it feels like it might not be dark, but rather edgy. I just wanted to see a public consensus on this.

So the main character is in this strange part of the world he knows nothing about. After saving the lives of two caravan mercs they offer to buy him a meal. At the eatery he notices in a VIP section a group of “monsters”. Ones a wraith, two are vampires, and the last is a Lycan.

A person dressed as an eatery servant (doesn’t matter if it’s a woman or a man)walks over and lays on the table. The monsters devour them in whatever way their species does. One of the mercs explains that this is how things are, since the monsters are useful in society and to wipe them out would be bloodier than it’s worth.

Later the main character would have a conversation with the wraith, something along the lines of “who’s the bigger monster? Me for feeding my urges? Or the men who sold me that person to eat?”

Is this edgy or am I worrying over nothing?"

I have conflicting feelings, personally, about how her storyline gets wrapped up. 

But I’m wondering what books are out there that might sort of follow this. Obviously it doesn’t need to be perfect, and I don’t imagine many protagonists will be quite as... complacent as Leilia can be in Maquia, but give me what you got."

300,Fantasy,Review: Misfit Mage By Michael Taggart,"I recently read this book and absolutely fell in love with it, and I wanted to share it here. It’s a paranormal story like you’ve never seen before. Michael Taggart weaves a story that is unique and fun. It is dark, but so much humor I was laughing through large parts of the book. I love how much creativity this book has, and I’ll remember the characters always.

The main character is Jason who has just discovered he is a supernatural through a major life altering event. His world is turned upside down when he realizes he can do magic, and that magic really is a thing. Along the way he makes amazing friends who feel more like family, and meets a man who puts his other lovers to shame.

Jason quickly discovers his limits in magic, but also finds places he excels at. He also realizes how dangerous the magic world is and how much he needs to catch up for he gets himself killed. But he is a problem solver with an abundance of creativity. Some of his solutions are amazing to behold (and super funny too)!

If you are looking for a humorous book with dark and deep undertones, then pick this up immediately. You won’t be sorry!

What’s a fantasy cover that made a big impression on you (or overall presentation of a book)? This has no relation to the content of the book. I’m talking about the cover itself and how it sparked your imagination before ever opening the thing and seeing what was inside. 

For me, it was a copy of The Worm Ouroboros in my local library I saw when I first got into fantasy in middle school: 

 https://images.app.goo.gl/2GYbQaifEkmxn7He6

306,Fantasy,One Mike to Read them All: I genuinely cannot think of a book I’ve had more fun reading than “One Day All This Will Be Yours” by Adrian Tchaikovsky,"I stand by that click-baity post title. This book was an absolute blast.

I do not say that lightly.

This felt like the literary equivalent of a good Will Ferrell movie. Or maybe the kind of movie that comes out when you’re in college, you watch it with a bunch of good friends and can’t breathe for laughing, and are quoting it endlessly to each other for the rest of your lives. (*Super Troopers* was the example for me, but I suspect the movie of choice varies greatly depending on when exactly you were born.) I need to get all of my friends to read this book *right now* so that we can spend years saying things like “let’s feed him to the allosaur!” and “Stalin vs Stalin!” and “I’m Caligula, get me out of here!” and laughing uproariously.

Anyway. Plot. The main character is the sole surviving veteran of the Causality War that left the entire timeline of  the universe shattered. The war was fought with time machines, with all sides working to erase the other side from existence while stomping on just the right butterfly to usher in the unending Golden Age for their side. Except that pretty quickly becomes impossible when the side you are fighting for wasn’t destroyed so much as never existed in the first place, but you keep fighting and fighting because … what else can you do?

Our protagonist ends up setting a future bottleneck, after all the destruction, and makes it his mission to keep any and all time travelers from getting past him. Humanity did a great job of fucking up the past, he wasn’t going to let them fuck up the future. So he’s living an introvert’s dream, on his farm at the end of time with his faithful pet allosaurus Miffly. He spends his days intercepting time travelers attempting to reach the future, killing them, and then temporally backtracking them to their origin and making sure that no one then ever discovered time travel in the first place. When he’s bored, he goes and hangs out with Plato or Charlemagne or Rick Astley in the drifting fragments of time that remain.

This idyllic life is abruptly ended when he gets visitors not from the past, against which he stands unsleeping vigil, but from the *future*. His own descendants, it turns out, which raises all sorts of questions when you’re the very last human in several senses of the phrase. But damn it, he’s worked hard to make sure that humanity does not exist in the future, and he is NOT going to take this lying down, whatever his descendants might feel about it.

This is a novella, so it won’t take you long to read, and it’s worth every second. I *really* need to read more of Adrian Tchaikovsky.

This seems very much out of style at the moment which is fine. But it seems like my two main options besides LOTR are Dragonlance and D&amp;D novels and of course Kings of the Wyld.

314,Fantasy,"What books have your favorite ""bonus materials""?","It's not uncommon for fantasy books to contain content other than the story itself. Something you see all the time is the map at the beginning of the book, helping readers understand where things are happening throughout the story. Other ones I've seen in multiple books are dramatis personae, definitions, and pronunciation guides. And of course, there's the classic preview of the next book in the series.

Recently, I've seen some books include more unique takes on these types of bonus materials. Two that stand out are **Cradle** and **Gideon the Ninth**. Cradle is pretty straightforward- at the end of the more recent books, Will includes a ""bloopers"" section to give you more humorous takes on different scenes from the book. These range from characters breaking the forth wall, making references to memes, or actually dying in one of those ""Learn or Die"" tests that mentors seem to love to give to their protégés. It's a fun chance to cool down after the end of the book, remember some things that happen and have a laugh at the ""What If"" scenarios.

Gideon the Ninth takes ""bonus materials"" to a whole new level. It has the dramatis personae, definitions, and next-book preview that I've come to see as normal. It also has a pronunciation guide for names, but Tamsyn makes it special by also explaining why she picked characters' names, often cheekily. For instance, one explanation that both cracked me up and tore me apart was this:

&gt; &gt;!""Isaac"" in Christain theology foreshadows JEsus' death by taking the wood for his own sacrifice up a mountain. Isaac here foreshadows Gideon's death by doing the ""bravest and stupidest"" thing, i.e. getting his abdomen made into a huge Connect-4 board.!&lt;

Tamsyn also includes some in-universe writing after the end of the book. There's an essay on the relationship between necromancers and cavaliers, as well as one character's strategic analysis on all of the characters in the book. Both give you a deeper connection to the world as well as a better understanding of what happens during the story.

I hope that other authors take note and start including these types of things in books when it's appropriate. I've found that I really appreciate those few minutes of remaining in the world after the story is over and being given the chance to learn more and to laugh more. What other books do you know of that do similar things?"
315,Fantasy,"Adult fantasy works that aren't overly gritty, depressing, or dark?","Does anyone have recommendations for books that deal with grown-up topics like complex ethical dilemmas and the intricacies of politics, science, and societies, that **aren't** trying to be grimdark?

I'm not exactly a big reader of fantasy, and so I'm open to the possibility of being totally wrong here. But it looks like a lot of modern fantasy is full of emotionally troubled orphans, anti-heroic protags that aren't really good people, capricious and tyrannical rulers and princes, sexual misconduct, and pointless violence.

Are there complex and deep works of fantasy that buck these trends (or my conception thereof)? Works with settings that are basically alright places to live, with rulers that are, while possibly weak and incompetent, still basically decent people with good intentions? And are there any such works that tend to be intellectually challenging and stimulating?

For reference, the last fantasy book that I enjoyed was *The Last Wish*, the first collection of short stories set in the Witcher-verse. And before that, I enjoyed the first three books of *A Song of Ice and Fire*, but heavily disliked the latter two."
316,Fantasy,Would you recommend to continue reading Dresden Files under these circumstances? (minor spoilers potentially),"So I just finished the second book of the dresden files series. I really enjoy the setting and worldbuilding, I love the narrator for the audiobooks in my language.

On the other hand, the constant ultra cringy ""woman describing"" he does for each goddamn female character is so grating after a while. Also I really dont like the plot device, that Harry is pretty much half dead and moaning about his mortal wounds for half the book. Every fight is like ""man I literally cant move and my head hurts and my shoulder hurts and my arms fall off and Im freezing..... but I took ALL MY WILLPOWER AND BOOOOOOM"".

Are those aspects at this level through the whole series or does it get ""better"" (for me at least)?"

319,Fantasy,[Review] Heir to Insanity by A.J. Nadir,"Heir to Insanity is the inaugural book in a coming series “Minutes to Madness” but is, for the most part, an enjoyable stand alone book as well. 

The book follows the characters Jasper and Ethan as they search for the “Everflame” (the book’s macguffin). They run into problems and meet new people along the way. The overall plot is reminiscent of the standard fantasy-quest trope. Some of the revelations are foreshadowed a little too heavily and fall a little flat after the buildup. 

Where the book excels is in the characters. Jasper and Ethan are not cookie-cutter fantasy heroes...arguably they aren’t even *good* guys. Using D&amp;D alignment I would say they are safely in chaotic neutral. The characters are complex and intriguing—with hinted at backstories and political context that push the plot. 

The magic system (systems?) is a little vague and can come across inconsistent but nonetheless is interesting and comes with drawbacks. 

All in all: 3.5/5 stars

323,Fantasy,My Complicated Feelings About Trigger Warnings,"Trigger Warning - frank discussions of sexual violence

Natasha Ngan’s *Girls of Paper and Fire* is a very intense book. It features in depth discussions of sexual abuse and systematic oppression, going out of its way to create a feeling of intense claustrophobia and helplessness in both its protagonist and its readers. Even though I am a survivor of sexual violence, I didn’t find it in the least bit triggering, and that, in part, is due to the warning in the front. 

 Backtracking a little, the biggest worry I have going in to a book that I know handles the topic of sexual violence is whether the author has done their research. Often, the answer is no, which leads to poor portrayals of the subject matter, something that has been discussed on this subreddit many times over. 

A bad portrayal of sexual violence is, personally, something I find to be much more upsetting than the mere portrayal of the subject matter in the abstract. Bad portrayals reinforce stereotypes and negative ideas that survivors have to grapple with every day, things that have often been reinforced by authority figures we have to interact with in the immediate aftermath of our assault. 

When an incident of assault is brushed aside, for example, and the character is not perturbed, upset, or even affected, this reinforces the inner monologue that survivors often have to contend with of ‘oh it wasn’t a big deal’ or  ‘I shouldn’t make as much of a fuss about this as I am’. This happening is rarely a result of authors not thinking sexual assault is a big deal, rather, confusion about what constitutes sexual assault. 

 According to the [met police,](https://www.met.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/rsa/rape-and-sexual-assault/what-is-rape-and-sexual-assault/) sexual assault is -

&gt; an act of physical, psychological and emotional violation in the form of a sexual act, inflicted on someone without their consent. It can involve forcing or manipulating someone to witness or participate in any sexual act.

 Those times where I’ve found a book to be particularly triggering are the ones where authors seem to use their own definition of sexual assault, which can range from ‘it’s only sexual assault if it’s extremely aggressive’ to ‘it’s only sexual assault if it’s full, penetrative sex and the man finishes’. 

Fantasy in particular seems to have a huge problem understanding what constitutes rape and assault, and it seems to be a bit of a thing where authors try their hardest to go as close to where they think the line is as possible, without going so far as to where they might have to actually do research or portray the effects of assault. 

Trust me on this though - if you think you can see the line, you should've been doing this sort of research at least a mile back. 

So what does all this have to do with *Girls of Paper and Fire* and trigger warnings? It’s simple, really. The trigger warning and author’s note at the start of the book assures us that the author is speaking from a place of personal experience, and confirms her intentions of wanting to respectfully explore these issues safely. Not just that, but a list of helplines are provided should readers need someone to talk to.

Not all trigger warnings are helpful, I’ve certainly been in the position of being given a vague trigger warning (generally in fanfic) and not being told when it’s going to happen, how, or to which character - something which leaves me on tenterhooks the whole way through, or worse, skipping through to see if I can find the triggering content, inadvertently spoiling myself. 

 Well written trigger warnings though, are more than just a warning sign for readers to avoid a work. It lets me know that the author cares about the difficult subject matter they’re attempting to portray, that they’ve done enough research to know that yes, what they put their characters through is sexual assault, and that more importantly, they respect their readers enough to not want them to put reading a book before their own mental wellbeing. Personally, this is enough to allow me to engage with content that I would otherwise really struggle with, and I'm grateful for that, as exploring my feelings about what happened to me through the media I consume has been a useful part of the healing process. 

Anyway please don’t eat me in the replies lol, I am aware this is a divisive topic, I just wanted to provide some of my own experiences navigating the SFF community as a survivor of sexual violence.

# ABOUT ME

I live in Manchester, UK. I used to consider myself a Ravenclaw but these days I’m definitely more of a Hufflepuff. I really like pizza. I used to teach English (hated it), and I’m a former freelance editor. Most of my spare time is spent reading, learning the basics of digital art (you can see the mixed results over on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/halfstrungharp)), and gaming. 

The past twelve months in lockdown have involved a LOT of the latter (video and tabletop). Though I used to exclusively play single-player RPGs like *Dragon Age*, I’ve also come to love chilled-out Switch games like *Animal Crossing* (is there anything more wholesome than inviting online friends to your island for a shooting star pyjama party?) and *Stardew Valley* (because what’s more relaxing than a sequence of fifteen-minute days of trying to cram in all the tasks necessary to maintain your farm while also balancing exploration, social interactions, expansion and customisation?).

These days, though, I devote all my downtime to one game in particular. I wouldn’t say I’m *addicted* to Final Fantasy XIV Online, but I’ve logged almost 800 hours since October (thanks for attacking me with that info, Steam), and snagging a house in the Lavender Beds might be the actual highlight of my year so far.

[Yes, I married my boyfriend in FFXIV too. This place has got everything](https://preview.redd.it/0lzfqcx2udm61.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e41c60c06f72ef83e313ab2bd49b07a2424758)

I also play a fair bit of D&amp;D (at least once a week), though we now have so many different campaigns on the go I have a small identity crisis each time we start a session.

# GNOMES

In 2018, I was approached by LitRPG publisher Portal Books to write a trilogy based on their new concept (“God Core”), beginning with a book called ***God of Gnomes***. Never having finished a full-length novel before (my first precious work-in-eternal-progress still languishes in its 1.5 million-word Scrivener file to this day), I was ever so slightly terrified. Then I signed the contract anyway, and embarked upon the steep, *steep* learning curve of writing LitRPG. Thankfully, readers seemed to enjoy the result!

Fast forward three years to today, where I’m celebrating the release of book two in the God Core series, ***Exodus of Gnomes*** (out now in [ebook](https://www.amazon.com/Exodus-Gnomes-God-Core-Dungeon-ebook/dp/B08X7LBNQT), [paperback](https://www.amazon.com/Exodus-Gnomes-Demi-Harper/dp/1913695115), and [audiobook](https://www.amazon.com/Exodus-Gnomes-God-Book/dp/B08XY5HCJ2)!).

# WHAT NEXT?

Right now I’m working on the final God Core instalment, *Rise of Gnomes*, and I’m still learning SO MUCH every day: about storytelling; about routines and self-discipline; and, most recently, about how many calories are in a teaspoonful of semen (thanks a lot, Kyle Kirrin and G.D. Penman in the (weirdly wholesome) chaos of the [Portal Books Discord](https://discord.gg/ESGmsAU7)).

As for life after *Gnomes*, my next project – an epic Norse-inspired progression fantasy – will be co-written with Luke Chmilenko and published by Wraithmarked Creative (with whom I also did [a group AMA here a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/l2nuej/hey_rfantasy_we_are_the_indie_publisher/)!) The working title is ""Nine Worlds"", and we're optimistically describing it as *God of War* meets *Cradle*.

331,Fantasy,What exactly makes the first law trilogy so “dark”?,"So a while back I read first law. I found it ultimately disappointing in consideration of what I was told but I still found it quite good, I’d say 8/10. 

But I hear people back and forth call it grimdark, and darker than other authors works. But what the hell is so dark about it that people are talking about? 

It has gore? Sure but gore isn’t exactly that dark and isn’t that present. Light description as it goes as I recall it. 

Glokta’s torture sessions? Yeah they showed some psychological manipulation here and there but again, I’m not that affected by gore. Once you see enough it’s all the same in my experience.

The characters being bad people? Sure there’s plenty, and sure while the heroes we see aren’t all very good people I don’t quite see what makes it all that dark or disgusting to peoples moral sensibilities.

My point in general is what do people who like this series mean when they call it dark? Because it seems no different than a lot of other, non dark fantasy I’m used to."

* The warrior carries an ancient sword whose hilt has been modified multiple times to suit the styles of many eras, but the blade itself has always remained unchanged.

* The warrior also has other weapons such as (maybe) small single-hand crossbows and a _telek_ dagger.

* I believe it was the first in a trilogy/series.

337,Fantasy,The Second Apocalypse/Aspect Emporer: Recommending the Grimmest of the Grimdark,"So, you like your novels grimdark, do you? Oh boy.

I’m writing this post as I’m finishing the final instalment of Scott Bakkers magnum opus and my mind is left reeling. The depth, the scope, of this series is something I have felt very rarely - finishing Malazan left a similar stain on my desire to read and I had to abandon Fantasy altogether for months before tentatively, like a wounded animal, to the genre.

And yet. Bakkers books are a series I would struggle to recommend. And I’m struggling to figure out why....

If only I had the ability to grasp complete control of human intellect, intelligence, and emotion.... I’d be capable of understanding. If only I was like the central character to this seven-book long treatise on belief, suffering, control, and humanity.

If only I was Kellhus Anasurimbor.

I sit here struggling to begin talking about these novels because to discuss them is to shed light on them and to shed light on them is to deprive the reader of the majesty of the unravelling mystery these novels possess - a set of novels that strive to be the Old Testament in fantasy form.

And yet I must - because to recommend this series must also come with warning. Because the content of the novels are unrelenting and stark and unpopular, because Bakker treats his readers like he treats his characters and hopes to bludgeon you with the evil that man can conducts on a visceral level, something you can’t just gloss over and move past. Something that makes you recoil. Something that must be recognised.

Your mileage may vary in how successful Bakker is in this regard. Bakker believes we as a society have become calloused to the atrocities we commit and therefore his depictions are extreme in order to elicit the appropriate reaction - to recognise that this is wrong. For some, this will read as clumsy and edgy. 

For others, that vileness is juxtaposed against beautifully gripping prose, against atavistic, achingly crafted history, and characters that are so human, so flawed and loveable and heartbreaking.  So alien, so contrasting against one another... stories of people grasping for hope, love, redemption. The success of their mission.

So.
 
How do you recommend a series like this? 

Kellhus Anasurimbor is Dunyain, he can read a human being like a children’s book - he anticipates, guides, and recruits those around him until they walk his path. He is ruthless, inhuman, and cruel beyond measure - and loved by all those around him.

He has been summoned by his father, who left the Dunyain long ago. He is a thousand leagues away. Kellhus leaves his sect after two thousand years of Dunyain isolation.

The signs of the second apocalypse are spreading. A war against Hell, against damnation itself. The No God is returning. Demons stalk the cities of Earwa with human faces.

A wizard by the name of Achamian is tasked by his School to monitor a new prophet raising up against these rumours. He is plagued by nightmares, like all of those in his particular school, of the first apocalypse. He lives it every night. He knows what is coming.

Achamian loves a whore named Esmenent. Esmenent is intelligent, she is bound to power, she had a daughter. She exists at the centre of these roiling times, and has to determine her fate.

And War between two nations has just begun. One side is led by a Scylvendi warrior who has had dealings with the Dunyain in the past. He alone knows what they are.

He is also Kellhus Anasurimbors guide into a new world.

If any of this intrigues you - I implore you to consider reading this series. If you are put off extreme levels of violence this is not the series for you, the series is criticised for its lack of female characters - this is remedied in the second half but again, it may not be for you.

But if you can move past these things   you will be rewarded with one of the richest, thought provoking, nihilistic and grimly detailed stories about humanity I have yet to read."

344,Fantasy,Raybearer Review: a near-perfect debut,"Raybearer is simply the best YA fantasy I have ever read. I need to see whole curriculums based around this book because it is indeed THAT good. 

Tarisai is a child born of a wish. A wish from her mother that destines her to kill the one she is supposed to love. And so begins a tale of magic, found family, and the Underworld. To say more would be to spoil all the wonderful surprises that Jordan Ifueko has cooked up within these brisk 350 pages. And trust me, you do NOT want to be spoiled.

One of my favorite things about this book is the PROSE. Jordan Ifueko's words were so lyrical and beautiful and they wove the story so intricately and vividly that it was so easy to fly through this book. Sentences wound their way inside my heart in the best of ways and I can't how many quotes I scribbled down because they were just too good.

But the story itself is just as wonderful as its wrapping. There are so many twists and turns that Ifueko could easily have stretched this out into a longer series but instead we are getting Tarisai's story completed later this year with Redemptor. This didn't feel like a debut novel. In all the best ways. You can come into this novel secure in the fact that you are dealing with a master storyteller who only has more amazing things for us in the future.

It's just bugged me since I was a teenager since she never finished her Mole Wars Trilogy.   


If you have children I would recommend her Serpents Egg Trilogy as I enjoyed them when I was young. The basic premise is group of kids go to a magical world, the portal is accessed from tunnels under Parliament hill in Ottawa, to stop a demon named hate.

347,Fantasy,Looking for Clean Fantasy,"Hello!  So I've seen some other posts looking for clean fantasy recommendations, but I have slightly different requests so I'm hoping it's okay I post this here!

What I've read and enjoyed:  Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan (though at a bit of a slump right now).  I read Zero Sum Game and really liked the math-as-a-super-power thing, though generally I'm less into sci-fi or stories that take place in our world / close resemblance to our world (including Mars / space stations).  I'd say I prefer 'high' fantasy. 

What I've read but not enjoyed:  The Ruin of Kings by Jenn Lyons -- I never finished it because I found it too uncomfortable.  Also not a fan of the timeline jumps.  The Fifth Season -- this was such a struggle for me because although her writing in the 2nd person was amazing, the scenes on the island didn't sit right with me.  As well, I found it hard to adjust to her sentence structures . . . I just found the writing had a weird flow.   

What I'm looking for:

\- No sex.  Like preferably no references at all.  For example, Warbreaker by Sanderson would probably be pushing it.  Bonus points if no romance.  

\- Little swearing.  It's okay if it's occasional or made-up.  

\- I'm pretty fine with violence if it's contained to wars / crimes which are integral to the plot.  Though I'd rather avoid torture.  

\- No YA.  I usually don't like YA because so much of it is centered around romance, however I'd be open to a YA novel if it is more philosophical / deep in nature or is super unique in setting / story. 

\- Not important, but it would be cool if it did not take place in a generic medieval England-esque place, or featured unconventional attitudes / beliefs.  I love the world-building aspects of fantasy.  

\- Open to novels or graphic novels.  

I'm sorry if this is way too specific!  As a side note, I've already heard great things about Discworld but have not gotten around to reading any of them."
348,Fantasy,Should I give Brandon Sanderson a second chance?,"So i finished the wheel of time recently and I think Brandon sanderson did a great job on completing the series. I have no real complaints other than I think the epilogue was too short, but that was written by Robert Jordan and i believe Sanderson wanted to keep Jordan's ending. 

After finishing the wheel of time I moved onto mistborn. It was really enjoyable. I liked his prose and the overall structure of the story, however as the story progressed something felt ""off"" with the themes of religion and belief, almost as if they didn't really fit that well into the story. Suddendly an event occurs and the theme now has a more dirrect connection to the story. The problem is that it was too direct and on the nose and the analogy to a certain real world religious figure was so obviois and laughable I couldn't help but laugh my ass off. Sadly I immediatly felt less interested in the story or the characters due to this theme and the analogy to the real world religious figure. 

I did some more digging and found that the rest of the mistborn trilogy deals heavily in this theme along with Sanderson's personal religion.

I like Sanderson as a person, and I think he's a great writer. I just don't think I liked the themes of this book. Should I try Stormlight archives instead?"

What are some of your guys favourite long or thick fantasy series? I’ve read Robin Hobb, Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan, Brent weeks etc. looking for some others that might not be as well known. Thanks 😊"
350,Fantasy,Looking for fantasy with military elements,Something that feels like The Black Company or even The First Law (not military but still war like). And it has to be dark and gritty. I read Shadow and Bone and wanted to throw it at the wall becuase I felt like I was reading twilight again.
351,Fantasy,Does R. Scott Bakker still have an online presence anywhere?,There hasn't been anything new on 3 Pound Brain for over a year.  Do any of you wise people have greater insight into this?
352,Fantasy,Labeling everything as anime-esque,"So after looking at a lot on the sub  and elsewhere I’ve started to notice something, people like to label a lot of shit as anime-esque.

If something’s over the top or considered melodramatic... it’s anime.

If something’s seen as childish... it’s anime

If there’s a hint of silliness... it’s anime

People in general often seem to blanket label things as anime, good things and bad things alike, with no regard for the massive amount of genres and sub genres that make up Japanese animation. 

Just an interesting observation, that is all."
353,Fantasy,"What, in your mind, makes a work of speculative fiction political? War and politics often aren't considered 'political,' but race and gender usually are - why the discrepency? What does it mean to you?","Had to bust out a throwaway because I'd rather not be doxed for asking a controversial question. But I honestly would love an answer! Like I've seen really good books looked over because they ""are too political and they are trying to escape into a fantasy land"" meanwhile they love the game of thrones books. I honestly would wanna know why is there a double standard."
354,Fantasy,Vampire: The Masquerade: Winter's Teeth [graphic novel] review,"4/5

VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE: WINTER'S TEETH VOLUME 1 is a collection of the first five issues of the Vampire: The Masquerade comic book by Tim Seeley, Blake Howard, and Tini Howard. I normally don't recover comics but I had to make an exception since I love both the tabletop game as well as Tim Seeley (Hack/Slash). 

It is set in the World of Darkness universe, popularized by the Vampire: The Masquerade tabletop and video games. We've been reviewing all of the issues here at Grimdark Magazine and think it would be inappropriate not to cover the graphic novel that was recently released. So, how is it?

In general, Winter's Teeth is a very solid and entertaining throwback to the Nineties Gothic Punk genre that eventually spawned things like Underworld as well as True Blood. It is a masqued world where the supernatural do their best to protect themselves from the prying eyes of mortals while carrying out sinister plots against, well, mostly each other. Vampires are fiercely competitive with one faction (The Camarilla) having a feudal structure and the other faction (The Anarchs) being, well, anarchic.

The comic is set within the Twin Cities of Saint Louis and Minneapolis. The cities have traditionally been considered separate domains but there's movement to combine them under one single Prince who will rule them all. Completely uncaring about these politics is protagonist, Cecily Bane, who is a former Anarch who has allowed herself to become a traitor to the cause in order to look after her ailing geriatric sister.

What follows is a complicated and entertaining set of events that reminds me very much of my tabletop RPG sessions for reasons both good as well as bad. There's a lot of really interesting storytelling going on but I also feel like the Storyteller (Tim Seeley in this case) occasionally throws in random crazy stuff to spice things up. At one point, a bunch of organ-harvesting cyborgs show up and I wondered if someone had been using their homebrew Mage/Vampire crossover material.

Cecily is a character that bounces between incredibly unlikable and entertaining in equal measures, which I think is the intent. She's someone who has become jaded on the conflicts of Anarch vs. Camarilla and it has burned her out. Unfortunately, that means she's unwittingly making enemies and does a few things that are just genuinely evil. Very true to the game but sometimes I felt like I wanted to see Cecily staked and left out for the sun.

Despite my issues, I absolutely did love the Byzantine plots and betrayals that fill up the story. Cecily recruits a young fledgling in hopes of restoring some of her lost humanity but secretly having let a snake into her home. There's a lot of humor to be had from the fact Cecily doesn't know how to deal with someone from the modern world even though she was Embraced in the Eighties.

Really, I actually enjoyed the back-up stories a bit more than the main story and I didn't dislike the main story. The Anarchs are a wonderful collection of oddballs and misfits trying to find their place in the world. Colleen is a fantastic Thin Blooded vampire (basically more human than monster) that is trying to serve as den mother to a bunch of dysfunctional monsters.

The art is lovely with the fact that not everyone is generically cute or drop dead gorgeous. The covers are particularly eye-catching as is usual for the medium. No one is shown for pure fanservice but still appealing to look at. It helps with the sense of ""realism"" that the vampires could be met on the street versus being Anne Rice's demigods. Hell, even Stephanie Meyer's.

In conclusion, I really do recommend this book but with some caveats that a slower pace might have actually been better. I wanted to follow up Cordell's vengeance scheme and get to know the Prince more. Vampire: The Masquerade is frequently about getting to know the major players of a single city. Even so, I very much enjoyed this and will be picking up the series as it continues on."

357,Fantasy,How appropriatr is the Temeraire series for a 6 year old?,"My 6 year old started listening to the first book in the Temeraire series (In Her Majesty's Service), I'm not even sure how she is following it with the rather abstruse nautical language, but after listening to it I realize it's not a childeren's book but she doesn't want to stop.  Is there going to be anything that would be horrendous for a 6 year old to hear?

She has listened to every LOTR and Chronicles of Narnia and loves both series. She's fine with war scenes (she's wierdly fascinated with medieval warfare history in fact) Though funnily enough the voice of Voldemort in Harry Potter freaked her out and we had to stop at book 2.  

I mostly don't want to be surprised by anything too steamy or distiurbing, so no Clan of the Cave Bear-like over-described sex scenes hopefully or any disturbing mix of sex and violence?"
358,Fantasy,Culture Clash Story Told From the Perspective of Non-Humans?,"Hello! 

I thought of this story concept and wanted to know if there were any recommendations that would be similar to this- **a human or group of humans traveling/finding themselves in an unfamiliar land, but the story is told from the perspective of the aliens/elves/non-humans that encounter them/capture them, and it focuses on or at least partially touches on the culture clash, especially if the non-humans can't understand the humans/there's no common language.** 

I came about the idea because I was thinking about the concept of trying to describe humans from an alien perspective; I remember reading a short story in high school that had that premise and I enjoyed it. I would prefer it to be a video game or comic, but I would definitely be fine with and open to movie or book recommendations too. 

If specifics for taste are needed, I enjoy dark fantasy like The Dark Crystal or Brom's fantasy books, but I would be open to regular fantasy or high fantasy as well. I would prefer it to not be urban fantasy in the vampire sense, I was thinking more along the lines of typical elves and wizards or sci-fi like Star Trek. I would prefer it to not be purely fluff/silly, and want some worldbuilding to sink my teeth into.

However! I'm open to any suggestions, and I appreciate you reading all this regardless of whether you can think of any or not."
359,Fantasy,Best Monsters that have a unique power?,"Some unique monsters that pop to my mind are medusa who turns people to stone, the hydra who’s heads regrew or even The Silence from Dr Who where anyone who sees them immediately forgets about their existence after looking away.

360,Fantasy,Fantasy not set in “medieval” or contemporary settings,"Why is it that the vast majority of fantasy is set in a medievalesque setting? Just a legacy from Tolkien? I’d almost argue that the classical period should be more popular a setting (you actually have pantheons of God’s, massive empires etc etc.).

What are some series that are set in other eras. I’d exclude modern urban fantasy since there are plenty of examples."

Now in this second book, I feel like there’s a serious lack of continuity. I’m confused about the history/background of this story. At some points, it seems like it is public knowledge that Nahadoth and Enefa/Yeine are back. At other times, it seems like everyone still thinks Itempas is the only “top” god. Also, I’m not sure why Oree seems to believe that there were no godlings around on earth before Yeine’s “ascension”, when Sieh and other children of the gods were around in book 1. Is it just that they were restricted to the place where the Arameri lived?

I guess I’m just really confused about what changed in terms of public belief since Yeine became a goddess, and what really happened to the godlings since then as well.

I can’t tell if it’s just my brain being dumb from being overworked and ADHD or if this book’s setting is actually just really confusing.

Please try to refrain from plot-ruining spoilers!! I’m at the part where Oree just sucked into the tree-place and is being inducted into a cult (???)"
363,Fantasy,Piranesi makes The Women’s Prize long list,
364,Fantasy,Vita Nostra - appreciation post,"&gt; *“Love is not when you are aroused by someone, it’s when you are afraid for that person.”* 

 Vita Nostra by Sergey &amp; Marina Dyachenko is a subtly ambitious novel that tackles several metaphysical concepts and challenges readers in untangling several of its layers. It's psychological mood, metaphors and unusual para-intellectualism dynamics worked so well that weeks after I read it I was left daydreaming much and haunted. I kept going back and forth on what I read and recounting what I thought I understood about it.   
It's summertime in Russia and Sasha Samokhina is vacationing in a seaside town with her mother. The young teen is pleasantly enjoying the weather, sand and the humble pleasures the boardwalk has to offer. However things take an ominous turn when she is confronted by a dark stranger and is tasked with what seems to be unusual but inane physical missions; upon completion of each task she is awarded with gold coins, however, compensation received is regurgitated from her own mouth. Upon failure from her first task, a love interest that Sasha's mother has befriended on the summer vacation suffers a heart attack, thus sets into play a cruel paranormal game of extortion her life has now entered.   
The plot is set on the premise of recruiting Sasha into a special college, The Institute of Special Technologies, a vague moniker to be sure but in keeping with many more abstract elements that lie ahead. The school is for students of unique potential, however, unlike other fantasy stories about schools of magic, this one has super fine print in the application for enrollment—get good grades and keep your mouth shut or horrible things will happen to you or your loved ones.     
  Needless to say, the curriculum is unorthodox and consists of a mix of scholarly and non-traditional pseudoscience techniques. We watch students journey through their years of regimental training and growth from semester to semester.   
  This is a book that encourages you to stroll along the gloomy halls of the abstract. Franz Kafka would be proud playing the headmaster role here, dragging the protagonist, Sasha, and her peers through dizzying trials and tribulations with absurd reasons. Why have they all  been forced to take part in this sordid scheme? What evil conflict or greater threat lies beyond the secret veil of this dark society? Is Sasha the chosen one? We see where we've come from, but where are our clues for what lies forward, or is this just a journey of mystery of the mind? Are we to discover something of ourselves and learn something further about inner identity?     
  The mood and visual setting that the Dyachenkos displayed is another aspect of the novel that ties the novel together nicely. Like the muted palette of a minimalist indie film, the dreary Soviet setting blends into dreamlike hazy environments and mirrors the sometimes snowy and confused minds of the struggling young students.   
  There are nice details in the quaint lifestyles Sasha and her mother make the best of. They are modest means,  sometimes antiquated, but both are nonetheless content with their livelihood. Torpa, the hardened provincial backdrop where the Institute is located is rustic and older, making isolation even more of a challenge—blanketing a snowy tabla rasa slate over the students.   
  At times, I felt as if Vita Nostra could have been written by a fantasy fan that wished to make their mark with an independent film entry in the Cannes Film Festival or Sundance, but still paid homage to many of their favorite tropes of school of magic and coming of age roots.   
  In the beginning of the story, we can reflect upon Sasha and her mother basking on a blissful seashore of sunshine at an age where such softer memories could still be found, but at the precipitous fulcrum of the storyline. Carefree are the bright doe-eyes of eagerness that the rays of light shine upon the innocence of youth only until the seeds of murky knowledge slowly grow their roots into their psyche. This was a fine and memorable sojourn from simpler times contrasted with what lay ahead as the writer's transition Sasha's growth and meaning with deeper, colder and a much more convoluted atmosphere; thus was the existential winter finals of their discontent ahead. 

&gt;“*The quiet before the storm. The hush of a cemetery. The silence that occurs when one runs out of words. The vacuum of a galaxy. Endless narrative; and the one who is listening is at once the narrator, the protagonist, the ear, the air, and the acoustic nerve.”* 

Vita Nostra’s subtle, yet powerful descriptions paint a tangible array of perceptions. Whether the visceral or the conceptual, it keeps the reader wanting more even after sinking into the Kafkaesque like narrative. The authors exhibit consistency throughout the story, keeping a picturesque landscape drawn in tribute to their snowy origins; whether it's the porous snow, nocturnal frost or the need of *winterizing* the windows, you know these folks have lived the big chill.     
  The descriptions of the familiar sounds of students in gathered revelry, the cadence of scholastic authority and crunching footsteps on fresh, first fallen snow, all help pull the reader deeper into the environment. After all, what’s a better description of youth than the nostalgic yet nauseated feelings of poor college-aged choices, like  anchovies in tomato sauce, with vodka and Pepsi.   
  In The Institute of Special Technologies, students are given rigorous instruction, but the cruel and unusual incentive methods set Vita Nostra apart from other books and drives much of the story's tension. Recruiters and staff have been known to extort, threaten, intimidate, coerce and even trap people in time-loops to force their compliance.      
  There, Sasha and her fellow students must memorize esoteric mental exercises in obscure textbooks, solve abstract math problems and listen to what seems to be silent recordings. Many times these must happen under pass or fail scenarios, should dire consequences await their loved ones—all of this is in accordance to the school's motto: 

“This institution of higher education had no such concept as mercy. *Vita nostra brevis est*... (our life is brief...)” 

  
  We never learn the purpose of the student's education and to what greater ends lie ahead for the next few years or even months at times. We bear witness only to the faculty raise the cream of the crop, through blood, sweat and tears, mirroring experimental CIA MK-Ultra or KGB black-ops like governmental training programs.     
  But soon, their studies change them, eventually uncoupling their very essences or even state of being from the physical plane. Nevertheless, advised in a state of predetermination, the students abide into the no-nonsense roles they must fulfill.     
  We journey alongside Sasha as students attempt to break down philosophical concepts, like Platonic forms. As they struggle to coalesce principles with their existing material environments, age old Greek allegories parallel story events as students delve further into their craft. Sasha even gains insight into multi-dimensional space.   The book may even go so far as to challenge readers further into deeper rabbit holes of quantum fields and realities, wave functions and other advanced concepts in physics should one care to connect and theorize.   
  Through the mystic science of “Word and Speech logic,” some students pass testing, reaching a newer range of knowledge. With this knowledge, students must come to terms with their new identities and even some, their abilities to manifest entities or even exit their corporeal shells as they learn to navigate time and space.     
  Further, in advanced levels, one can exercise ideas of multiple existing realities at uncertain points in time as transcendental beings and learn how they can reach interaction points with their constituents thus gaining fuller understanding of the “Informational Universe.”   
  But the story is not all dense metaphysical training into the obscure and abstract and without much of the human emotional element. Many primary themes are deal in adolescence with its transition to early adulthood: social anxieties, the baffling dawn of sexuality, the new and uncontrolled powers that come with physical changes.   The book shows us many of the awkward moments of discovery and coming of age, first loves, heartbreaks or regrets, rivalries, traditional growing pains and young adult rites of passage. Many of these issues collide with the simultaneous sense of one’s individuality and insignificance in the grand scheme.

&gt;“*I’m afraid for her!” Sasha screamed through her tears. “She must be... She will be fine, won’t she? Tell me!”* 

We were able to get deep into the head of Sasha, the only POV in the story, as she undergoes much emotional turmoil and externally-induced stresses from the school curriculum and environment. It was a dramatic experience to follow along her transformation, enduring her mental anguish while also navigating her attempts to maintain her family and relationships with superiors and peers. Some supporting cast characters fit stereotypical roles, at times were uncompelling and did not push the narrative. But, the book balances this with Sasha’s more compelling journey to figure out “what makes us who we are” and the sacrifices we must bare.     
  At times, it was crushing to see the metaphorical and literal metamorphosis of Sasha. We empathize with her as she changes from a coerced, naive and homesick freshman into a feared, studious, talented school stand-out. But hardly no fault of her own as the institute uses these young people through extreme measures and attempts to exorcise the last remaining bits of their humanity in a clandestine project of greater purpose. Her growing aggression and wild instability adds a new tension in the plot as we see her progress in development.   
  However, it is with Sasha’s unique ability among her class which fast tracks her ahead, but at the same time troubles her scholastic journey. As in most stories, being an unusual talent makes the protagonist somewhat of a social pariah and Sasha is not exempt from these issues. At times, these flaws become blessings and curses and uses them to unexpected results—finding savage danger but unique advantage and discovery.   
  In Vita Nostra one can feel a cynical tone and a dark humor between the lines. There is the existential angst but also the stoicism needed to think about these topics. At the same time, you can feel the protagonist holding on to humanity's last strings of youthful sarcasm and immaturity, the last dregs of irresponsibility, but still understanding it's need to let go.     
  The novel plays with so many ideas and even questions reality itself at times, just as one of Sasha's professors Portnov rationalizes: *“Memories are projections of events, and in this case it is much less important whether the events are real or not.”* It can be a coming of age story but with the untethered freedoms that fantasy has as allowing the metaphorical become the literal as the Dyachenkos combines metamorphosis, change, choice and self-will, but taking all these components exponentially farther.

367,Fantasy,boomwyrmz' Harrow the Ninth Review Part 1,"After completing the Lyctor trials in 𝐺𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑜𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡ℎ (spoiler line of which you have now officially crossed), Harrow and Ianthe are, along with the rest of the surviving Lyctors, taken by the Emperor to a super-secret space station on the other side of the universe, where they prepare for the attack of the ghost of one of the planets that were killed ten thousand years ago during the Resurrection (very necromantic).

Welcome to my thoughts on 𝐻𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑤 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡ℎ, or as I like to call it: 𝑀𝑒𝑒𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝐿𝑦𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠™.

Now, you would expect someone who has been around for the last ten thousand years to be pretty chill. The whole wisdom of the ages thing and whatnot. But these guys are not chill. In fact, we can do a little thought experiment to illustrate just how un-chill these guys are: Take all the paranoid, pubescent and all-powerful pricks that we met in the first book, and give them some ten thousand years and the entire universe to run around and do even more stupid and evil shit that will (in some cases quite literally) haunt them for the rest of their never-ending lives. Congratulations, you now have the Saints of the Emperor, his hands and gestures, the Lyctors.

The thing I love about the Lyctors is how (despite being thousands of years old) human they are. They act all high and mighty, but each of them has their own little quirks and issues, and they all have their heads stuck inside their own asses (although this might be true of all of Muir's characters in general).

In their first scene together, they're at Cytherea's wake, this once-in-a-decade big family reunion, and like every other family, it takes them all but five minutes to start bickering and hissing at each other over some tiny thing from (thousands of) years ago. It made me feel right at home with them and with this book.

Is there a scene that made you immediately know that what you are reading is going to be great?

I still have a lot of things to say about 𝐻𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑤 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑁𝑖𝑛𝑡ℎ so stay tuned for more of that later.

Bidding you all a magical day,

368,Fantasy,"We, the readers, deserve The Doors of Stone",Simply put we fell in love with this world 14 years ago and the last book came out 10 years ago. It's one thing to be patient but some of us started reading this as freshman in high school and have graduated college and still waiting for book 3
369,Fantasy,Does fantasy fiction create the right mindset for conspiracy theories?,"So the protagonist uncovers a secret - it may involve demons, aliens, ghosts... or sharks. When told of it, people don't believe them because they're either not interested, greedy, in on it or just plain mean. Finally the truth comes out and the protag is proved completely right. Fade to black. Read *Catcher in the Rye*.

How many times does this happen in books, film and tv? On the other hand, how often is the conspiracy proved utterly false?

If you think of everyone being the main character in the story of their own life then doesn't this reinforce conspiracy theories? The secret information, the disbelief of others, why it's just like \[insert story name here\]. And like the story, you'll eventually be exonerated and be the hero, right?

TLDR: In stories the conspiracy theory is always true so it will be in real life."

Last year, I finished reading the first trilogy of what ended up being the Saga of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever. I have not read the second, nor the last crhoicles.

To my delight, I found it *very* thought provoking. It was also incredibly frustrating becasue of the main character, and slow paced at times. The second book, specially, could have reduced by half. Still, I *wanted* to know how it would all be resolved. 

What about you, though? If you've read it, I think it's a pretty good work to discuss; both its story, and its themes."
373,Fantasy,"New Reader, Completed Bingo Card, and a Big Thanks","Historically, I’ve never been a big reader.  Reading a few books a year in high school and college on miscellaneous topics that caught my interest - I was *very* casual at best.  In late 2019, I found my way in to audiobooks, which opened up a **whole new world to me**.  I found myself reading a whole book every week or two.  I was in love.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
In 2020, I found fantasy, and r/fantasy.  I’ve been a fan of the style for a long time (movies, shows, a bit of D&amp;D in my elementary school days, etc.) but never a fantasy READER.  If finding audiobooks was  opening up a new world, finding fantasy was **finding my home**.  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
To my joy, I found out that r/fantasy has a community BINGO card!  What fun, and what great timing for me!  Just finding my way in to the genre, I was still trying to figure out what I liked, what I didn’t like, what authors were popular, what the current trends and styles are and what was going to keep me interested and invested in my reading adventure.  It’s been great fun this year exploring the subreddit, planning out my card and getting excited about what’s next on the list.  
&amp;nbsp; 
  
Finally, before I get in to my BINGO card, I just wanted to say *thank you.*  r/fantasy has been a great resource for me.  Although I’m not super active and lurk more than anything (I feel like I’m still new, and haven’t quite earned my stripes yet), it has been just wonderful to have such an engaged community that openly makes recommendations and discusses what they love with other like minded enthusiasts, like myself.  It has been so helpful, not just in planning out my card, but really getting IN to reading.  One of the biggest things I’ve found is that all of this is a lot more fun if I’m excided about what I’m reading or about to read, and over and over again, r/fantasy has helped me get excited.  **Thank you all so much.**  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
So, here we go!  Here’s my completed card: **[Card View]( https://i.imgur.com/T16pFXN.jpg), [Grid View]( https://i.imgur.com/bGjasVM.jpg)**.  
  
I used u/improperly_paranoid spreadsheet (thanks!), and modified it a bit for my planning and tracking.  I read around (50) books total this year, so there were several that could fall in to a few of these spots, but I’ve sorted them out so that I can talk about my favorites.  Also, (12) of them ended up HARD mode, which is cool.  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Translated** - *The Last Wish* (Andrzej Sapkowski): 2.5-stars LIKED: Fairytale re-tellings, a believable, grungy world, complicated moral provocations, MONSTERS (yeah!).  DISLIKED: rough treatment of female characters (believable as it may be, I just found it upsetting at times), I didn’t really CARE about Garalt, or what he had going on.  
  
**Snow, Ice or Cold** – *The Left Hand of Darkness* (Ursula K. Le Guin): 2.5-stars.  LIKED: The ice planet setting seemed well thought out and explored.  I also like the idea of a future so distant, that human settlers on a new planet might not fully embrace other humans and see them as alien.  I though there were some cool ideas regarding sex/gender that must have been ahead of their time.  DISLIKED: the story just seemed to drag on time to time and I lost interest at a few points, making me want to move on to something else.  I think this may have mostly been due to the age of the book, and the way “traditional” sci-fi stories were told.  
   
**Optimistic** – *The Goblin Emperor* (Katherine Addison): 3-stars.  LIKED: I enjoyed the non-human world, even though the differences weren’t stark, the main character was reluctant and positive, which together made him it very easy to empathize with him.  DISLIKED: Complicated names and titles – I often lost track of characters and their roles, and many times just had to go along with the story not knowing who was who.

**Necromancy** – *Dead Beat (Dresden Files #7)* (Jim Bucher): 4-stars.  LIKED:  The most fun Dresden Files yet, “Polka will never die!”, a frigg’n reanimated t-rex, yeah!!
  
**Ace / Aro** – *All Systems Red* (Martha Wells): 3.5-stars.  LIKED: Our unfriendly, introverted, main character is oddly relatable to anti-social types, the story length was great and perfect for an introduction to the Murderbot.  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Features a Ghost** – Sabriel (Garth Nix): 4-stars.  LIKED: A very interesting world, I very cool magic system, that I’m ready to learn more about in the sequels.  This really felt like a small story in a much larger world.  Also, the audio book was narrated by Tim Curry, which was very cool.
  
**Exploration** – *We are Legion (We Are Bob)* (Dennis E. Taylor): 3-stars.  LIKED: a very cool idea, and main character/s concept that I hadn’t seen before, a lot of cute, pop-culture referential humor.  DISLIKED:  I didn’t care so much about Bob, I’m not sure why.  It was fun, but I doubt I’ll continue with the series…We’ll see.  
  
**Climate Fiction** – *Depart, Depart!* (Sim Kern): 5-stars.  A lot of very thought provoking ideas  about gender identity, our climate emergency, the familial burdens that are passed to us, and the very real threat of safety to trans people.  It’s a story that feels very fantastical and very real and possible at the same time.  This is a great one, and it’s a short read that sucked me in to reading all in one sitting.
  
**Color in the Title** – *The House on the Cerulean Sea* (T.J. Klune): 5-stars.  One of my favorite books of the year!  The characters and their story are just so heartening and really drew me in to their world.  It was the perfect cure for the 2020 blues!  
  
**r/Fantasy Book Club / Read Along** – *Empress of Salt and Fortune* (Nghi Vo): 2-stars.  Not a whole lot to say about this one.  It just didn’t really draw me in, like it was hoping it would.  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Self-Published** – *The Wandering Inn* (Pirateba): 3-stars.  LIKED: A lot of fun characters, we really feel like we’re going through the MC’s journey with them, the Lit-RPG aspect was fun while not being annoying.  DISLIKED:  The story definitely felt like it could’ve used some editing.  I really disliked the secondary MC, the runner.  I’m sure they were set up to be redeemed, but I disliked them so much I didn’t even want to read their chapters any more.   
  
**Chapter Epigraphs** – *The Final Empire* (Brandon Sanderson): 4-stars.  What can I say about ol’ Brando Sando that people don’t already know.  The man knows how to write a book!  LIKED: The story flowed well, and was engaging and easy to follow, the characters were great, the magic systems is undoubtedly cool.  DISLIKED: As cool as the magic system is I found myself bored by how it’s all just laid out as if it’s just another aspect of science that we don’t currently have.  This is where I of course learned about the difference between “hard” and “soft” magic systems, and my own preference for “softer” magic systems that may have a bit more wonder to them.  
  
**Published in 2020** – *Mexican Gothic* (Silvia Moreno-Garcia): 3-stars.  LIKED:  The world of the book was cool, and not a “traditional” fantasy/sci-fi setting, the time period/style was very cool and a nice break from the typical.  DISLIKED: I didn’t like the main character.  She prided herself on her ability to charm/manipulate people, which is just a personal characteristic that really puts me off.  This made it hard for me to want to root for her.  
  
**School or University Setting** – *The Wise Man’s Fear* (Patrick Rothfuss): 4.5-stars  LIKED:  Rothfuss is just such a good writer, I kept looking for excuses to read as much as I could in a day.  The audio book was 40-some hours long, and that didn’t bother me in the least.  I was just fully sucked in to the story.  DISLIKED: as with The Name of the Wind, this book has questionable male-female dynamics that made me roll my eyes more than once…  
  
**Book About Books** – *Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore* (Robin Sloan): 3-stars.  LIKED: the story was fun enough, and I was  interested in seeing where it would go, and what was going to happen next.  DISLIKED: I really didn’t find myself caring about the main character at all.  The story ended up being pretty right-down-the middle, and neither great nor awful for me.  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Made You Laugh** – *Kings of the Wyld* (Nicholas Eames): 3.5-stars.  LIKED: The story is as fun as everyone says, the pop-culture references were fun to find and figure out, Moog was my favorite character – an old, gay, bumbling-but-competent wizard was exactly what I didn’t know I needed.  DISLIKED: I got a bit lost in the world a few times.  I feel like I would have liked a bit more explaining from time to time to help appreciate the characters experience.  
  
**Five Short Stories** – *Stories of Your Life and Others* (Ted Chiang): 3.53-stars (total, weighted per story).  This includes the short story that the movie Arrival was based on.  LIKED: Tower of Babylon, Understand, Story of Your Life, Seventy-Two Letters, Hell is the Absence of God, Liking What You See: A Documentary.  DISLIKED: Division by Zero, The Evolution of Human Science.  
  
**Big Dumb Object** – *Leviathan Wakes* (James S.A. Corey): 4.5-stars.  One of my favorite of the year!  The world created in this story just feels SO real and developed.  It’s all feels not-just possible, but likely, and so well actualized without being overwhelming.  I’m ready to read to read the second installment, it’s just another long one, so I’ve been putting it off as it’s quite an undertaking.

**Feminist** – *The Calculating Stars* (Mary Robinette Kowal): 5-stars.  A contender for best of the year!  This one ticks many of the boxes I love: space, space race nostalgia, women’s rights, an underdog story.  It’s all great!  I loved how the MC seemed so real and appropriate for her time.  Although she was very smart and talented and driven, she never seemed like a current from the 2020’s transplanted into the 1950’s.  I also loved how well the story moved along, and each chapter clearly moved the MC and the story along, much like an episode of a really good TV show.  

**Canadian Author** – *The Rage of Dragons* (Evan Winter): 5-stars.  ANOTHER contender for best of the year!  I loved the setting and people of the story.  It all felt so new and fresh that I was truly drawn in.  I loved the characters arc of growing their abilities, and thought it was a great way to level up a characters strength within the framework of the story.  I was a big fan!  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Number in the Title** – *Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City* (K.J. Parker): 3.5-stars.  LIKED: the main character was fun and crotchety, I appreciate the problem after problem solving abilities of an engineer approach – it felt fresh compared to a lot of stories.  DISLIKED:  The story did seem to drag at times.
  
**Romance** – *This is How You Lose the Time War* (Amal El-Mohtar &amp; Max Gladstone): 4.5-stars.  I really liked this one.  For me, it was a great mix of imaginative settings/world building, and creative story telling.  I’m sure I missed some things along the way, but I was just along for the ride!  I also thought it had a great cover.  
  
**Magical Pet** – *His Majesty’s Dragon* (Naomi Novik): 4-stars.  I loved Temeraire.  He’s like if you have the most loyal, loving dog ever that could talk with you, and you could also fly in to battle.  Simultaneously delightful and adventurous!

**Graphic Novel** – *Monstress, Vol. 1 &amp; Vol. 2* (Margorie Liu): 3 to 3.5-stars.  LIKED: A very cool and detailed world, creative setting and world/social structure, very cool and beautiful artwork.  DISLIKED: It just seemed like a lot of misery and miserable people.  If I had my druthers, I’d just prefer to be having fun while reading.

**Features Politics** – *Assassin’s Apprentice* (Robin Hobb): 3-stars.  LIKED: the magic system is cool, and the story felt like there was a lot of world out there to explore.  DISLIKED: Fritz.  He just seemed like such a sad-sack for the whole story, and I didn’t really care what happened to him along the way.

Thanks everyone for reading, and for all the help reading."
374,Fantasy,Illustrated fantasy books for kids,I'm looking for recommendations for kid-friendly illustrated fantasy books. I have a 6 month old and I want to be able to share my love of reading with her as she grows.
375,Fantasy,"I created a Fantasy Chill Magic playlist full of Celtic, medieval and new age instrumentals",
376,Fantasy,Unpopular Opinion: We (the readers) are owed The Doors of Stone and The Winds of Winter.,"OK. George R.R. Martin is not my b#tch, Patrick Rothfuss is not my b#tch. 

Fine, I read their books but I never entered into a contract with them. Not even a social contract, to have a complete series. 
George never said to me “buy this series, the ending is great”. Pat never said to me “Just wait for the third book, it’s the best and it makes reading the first two worthwhile”. Maybe they don’t owe me anything.

But Penguin Group DAW, and Pat’s editor Betsy Wollheim, owe me a book. They owe you a book. They owe your friend that you recommended The Name of the Wind to a book. The owe me a book. They put The Kingkiller Chronicle #1 on the front of that book, and I bought it because I was induced to believe it will have an ending.

Same with Harper Voyager/Bantam, and Anne Groell. You owe me some books. I want my The Winds of Winter and whatever other books it takes to get their plot wise. I bought multiple copies of the first books. You Harper Voyager/Bantam, got to keep the majority of the profits from those sales. YOU not GRRM. I can do the math you made over a 100 million dollars off of this series-minimum and the only ending I got was Season 8 because you didn’t deliver your on your end. Arrgh.

Alan Rinzler got **Hunter S. Thompson to deliver** as he promised. That guy did a lot of drugs and drinking, but his editor still got him to turn in the pages on time (and even went back to school and got a Masters in Psychology to figure out how to do a better job of it). But her got  **Hunter S. Thompson** to deliver. And you cannot get a sweetheart like Pat or a brilliant hard worker like George to turn out some pages? 

Publishers do F***ing your job!

 Meet your authors needs and get what needs to be done done to get us the books you promised.

r/fantasy is lucky TOR had Harriet. She kept her promises and TOR’s promises for them. She moved heaven and earth to do so. RIP Robert Jordan.

**TL;DR Author’s don’t owe us. Their publishers and editors do, and they have to work to make sure that they keep their promises.**"

## Translated : The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Steward

Why translated ? I read it in french !

This book is a middle grade fantasy book about exceptional young orphans trying to save the world.
I thought it was similar to `A Series of Unfortunate Events` but a bit more cheerful.

Overall it was alright but not great, I did not really enjoy how the plot got resolved. As a kid I think I would have loved it I think but nothing really caught my attention.

Quote :

3/5 Stars

## Snow, Ice or Cold : The girl and the stars by Marl lawrence

I really loved the Book of the Ancestor trilogy, and having a new trilogy in the same world interested me. I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about it. 

This book did pay off on that side as we dug deeper into the worldbuilding, but I had a hard time getting interested in the characters and the icy settings was less appealing this time.

It was alright, I'll probably read the next book in the series but I would say it's not close to red sister quality wise.

Quote : 
&gt; “When I was last here’ – he swung his arm at the rock and ice – ‘all this was fields.”

3/5 Stars

## Optimistic : The House in the Cerulean Sea by T.J. Klune

For this square I also read ""The Curse of Chalion"" since it was recommended as Optimistic. I think it was one of my most depressing reads of the year and I did not really liked it so I refused to use it here.

Instead I read this book by T.J Klune and I absolutely loved this one ! It was a sweet and easy read, without much surprise but enjoyable.

Optimistic definitely fits and the tone of book was really enjoyable. I highly recommend it to people who enjoyed the Goblin Emperor.

Quote : 
&gt; “Today he wore blue socks with clouds on them. Linus refused to be charmed. He mostly succeeded.”

4/5 Stars

## Necromancy : The Divine Dungeon Series by Dakota Krout

A co-worker recommended this series to me. I read it entirely but I cannot recommend it and I kinda regret it. The first book was definitely not great but I decided to keep reading.

From a ""not great"" start it quickly went down to a ""quite bad"". It often feels like there is not real plot development and the characters aren't developed either. I kept reading because I was hoping for some kind of payoff and it was not hard to read. Well there was no payoff, actually the ending is really unsatisfying.

Also something bothered me, the character's morality also felt ""Icky"", definitely a lot of ""Might makes right"" undertone and "" You would do the same if you were in power"".

There is some necromancy in the book but it's not a Necromancy focused book.

Quote : 
&gt; ""If I ever die, I want you to be the one to lower my body into the ground, just so that you can let me down one last time.""

Book 1 : 3/5 Stars
Book 2 to 5 : 2/5 Stars
Overall : 2/5 Stars ! 

Readable but I do not recommend that you do.

## Ace / Aro : The Torch that Ignites the Stars by Andrew Rowe

I knew I would read the next book on the Arcane Ascension series for this square even before I knew the release date of the book. The main character is Ace but not Aro.

I really love this series and it is everything the Divine Dungeon is not :

  * The prose is better (even if it could be even better).
  * The plot is better even if it's scope is hard to grasp sometimes.
  * The characters are miles aboves and I love the tone of corin's narration.
  * The action is always interesting and I am never bored reading it.

The third book did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the 'Summer vacation' vibe and hope we get another similar one for book 6.

I know the series has room for improvement, and I feel like the author is improving, but this series just hooks me in 100% and I can't put it down once I start and I am waiting for the audiobook in may to re-read it.

And the book ends with a cliffhanger that should be illegal. Definitely immoral. I can't wait for the next one.

&gt; ""Draw your sword.""

5/5 Stars. Flawed but shoot that stuff up my veins please

## Recs ?

My favorites for this row are definitely The Torch that Ignites the Stars and The House in the Cerulean Sea."
378,Fantasy,"Brutal, Epic, Heroic Fantasy ?","I'm reading A Time Of Dread by John Gwynne at the moment and i am immensely enjoying it. Like others said about Gwynne's books, it reminds me of why i fell in love with fantasy in the first place. It has a Tolkien feel but more modern.

I didn't read The Faithful &amp; The Fallen (yet) and i actually prefer it that way, the past feels like a legendary age and i can relate to the younger protagonists (Drem, Riv and Bleda, although i love Sig too!) who haven't lived through it and for whom it probably feels the same.

I'm struggling to find anything similar to Gwynne's books.

What i particularly like in A Time Of Dread : Brutal, Epic, the Ben Elim &amp; the Kadoshim, giants warriors riding bears, talking crows, legendary orders of warriors, creepy cults, the sense of incoming disaster, a fascinating past of wars and heroes, characters with a mysterious past, no traditionnal cities...

Also i enjoy the fact that even tough there is practically no magic the world feels very magical. 

Any recommendation based on all that ?"
379,Fantasy,Robert Jordan’s Prose deserves way more credit than it gets and Patrick Rothfuss’s Prose deserves way less.,"Seriously, Jordan’s prose is really good. I don’t understand why people don’t generally praise this part of his books. Everyone praises Patrick Rothfuss’s Kingkiller Chronicle a lot and I honestly don’t get it. Rothfuss’s prose seems way too flowery, extremely self-indulgent, like he was trying way too hard with it. Most of the time, I was rolling my eyes at how pretentious Kvothe sounded (he also seems like a major self-insert, btw). Despite all this, people seem to swoon over these books, treating them like they’re the pinnacle of good writing.

But when it comes to the wheel of time books, I haven’t seen much praise regards to the writing, despite the text feeling way more organic and free-flowing. It may meander at times but it never feels self indulgent or unnecessary. His text feels like I’m watching something unfold instead of reading a character’s thoughts over and over again. And its been like that from the very beginning. I was honestly amazed when I first read the prologue, Dragonmount. The picture he painted with his words there was something truly magical"

384,Fantasy,The most tragic narratives in Fantasy?,"So, I’ve read GRRM, I’ve read Abercrombie 

And I’m craving a good, uncliched, deconstruction of fantasy

A trilogy or series that flips every (or at least most) tropes on its head 

Chapters that leave me shocked in awe and has me believing I didn’t just read what I just read 

Characters that have little plot armor.. important characters that you think are driving the narrative forward suddenly dying in an instance. Not some master or lover that they then have to avenge no .. i mean truly shocking and unexpected deaths 

Mysteries and twist. Preferably one big twist but small little ones will do 


“Click, tap, pain” Characters so strong and diverse they are jumping off the page at you 

I’ve been recommended 

Realm of Elderlings
The Traitor Baru Cormorant 
Malazan series 
Assassin’s Apprentice
Fate of the Fallen
The Prince of Nothing series 

So which one is it? Or is it another series entirely"
385,Fantasy,Para's Proper Reviews: Masks and Shadows by Stephanie Burgis,"I knew I have to read this immediately as soon as I saw the blurb. Historical fantasy set in 1779 Habsburg empire, featuring alchemy, a castrato, a widow, and a Prussian spy? At a time where I’m explicitly interested in the 18th century? (My current focuses might be France and Prussia, but I’ll take what I can get.) Yes. Yes please.

And this time, I was not disappointed. It was so much my catnip.

The plot mostly revolves around Charlotte, a widowed noblewoman who came to Esterháza to visit her sister (the mistress of the prince), Carlo, a castrato singer who’s visiting as a guest, and a bunch of creepy alchemists who are clearly up to something sinister.

What I loved the most about it was that clearly, a lot of love and research went into it. Crossdressing at a masquerade ball? Perfectly historically accurate, and my favourite detail. There’s even a note in the end on what characters and major events was accurate and where it diverged from history for the sake of the story. Music is also very important (the author studied music history and did her PhD in Vienna!) and we even get Haydn as a side character.

The romance between Charlotte and Carlo was also something I enjoyed, not exactly traditional as far as romances go. I also found it interesting that not everyone’s ending was happy. Some side characters died, some antagonists escaped consequences. Uncommon for books with a romance subplot this prominent.

The only complaint I have is that the book could really do with a tighter focus. There are a *lot* of POVs, especially for such a short book. The Prussian spy I was looking forward to was, in the end, a completely pointless character that could have been removed without affecting the plot in any way whatsoever, and there’s not just one, but two unwilling alchemist accomplices that kind of blended together in my mind.

Regardless, I found it to be a very fast, engaging read. The short story epilogue, *Shadow Duet*, telling us what happened to Charlotte and Carlo after the ending of *Masks and Shadows* is also well worth checking out.

387,Fantasy,So Long and Thanks for all the Cliffs. . . 2? Bingo Mini-Reviews and Rankings,"This has been my first year participating in the [r/Fantasy book bingo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ft254j/official_rfantasy_2020_book_bingo_challenge/), which has quickly become one of my favorite reading challenges. To complete the board, you need to read 25 books (well, 24 books and a handful of short stories) by 25 different authors, all fitting into various bingo categories. It's been a wonderful way to try new authors that might've otherwise languished on the TBR while I binged my favorites--or perhaps may not have been on my radar at all. I completed [one bingo card](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ikjb8j/so_long_and_thanks_for_all_the_cliffs_minireviews/) back in August, but I was having so much fun that I decided to try a second, with the added challenge of not repeating any authors from my first card. It was, again, a whole lot of fun, although it's led me to starting so many new series that I'm pretty well drowning in unread sequels. Next year, I'm going to have to make a card of all sequels and see who's kidding who.


1\. **The Nothing Within** by Andy Giesler



Categories (place on my board in bold): **Self-published**



Mini-Review: A post-apocalyptic, Amish-inspired dystopia. Yes, you read that right. Enthralling from the start, with the first-person narrative delivered by an itinerant oral storyteller, interspersed with journal entries from the long-ago apocalypse. Not sure that I’ve read anything like this, and it was tremendous, with excellent characters that carried the start and an intriguing plot that picked up around the 33% mark.  



Rating: **18/20**



Cliff Severity: The door was certainly left open for future action, but this book has a complete and satisfying arc and would work as a stand-alone if the author decides not to return to this world. 

2\. **The Arm of the Sphinx** by Josiah Bancroft



Categories: Politics (hard), Exploration, **Epigraphs (hard)**, Big Dumb Object



Mini-Review: Picks up where Senlin Ascends left off, with plenty of adventure, more fleshing out of secondary characters, and deeper exploration into the mysteries of the Tower of Babel. I had trouble putting it down, and I’d heartily recommend to anyone who liked Senlin Ascends. 



Rating: **18/20**



Cliff Severity: This book had a fairly satisfying arc within the overall arc of the series, but there are still two books left, and this one has quite a sequel hook. 




3\. “And They Were Never Heard From Again” by Benedict Patrick, “A Guide for Working Breeds” by Vina Jie-Min Prasad, “If You Want to Erase Us, You Must Be Thorough” by L. Tu, “Open House on Haunted Hill” by John Wiswell, and “Proof of Existence” by Hal Y. Zhang



Categories: Five Short Stories



Mini-Review: I artificially inflated the rating here by eschewing hard mode and cherry-picking my five favorite stories of the year. The Patrick and Tu stories are darker, and the Wiswell and Prasad entries are a bit lighter, but they’re all excellent. 



Rating: **18/20**



Cliff Severity: Short stories, as usual, don’t really have cliffhangers, although some end with uncertainty. 




4\. **A Wizard’s Guide to Defensive Baking** by T. Kingfisher



Categories: **Politics (hard)**, Self-Published, Magical Pet, Published in 2020



Mini-Review: On the darker side of middle-grade, a teenage wizard with an affinity for bread finds a dead body in her Aunt’s bakery and is thrown into the middle of a conspiracy against those with magical ability. There are some fairly predictable plot points, but there was enough uncertainty to keep me interested as an adult reader, and the juxtaposition of depth and humor was striking. The characters were fun, the magic system was fascinating (I say as someone typically unmoved by magic systems)...this one does pretty much everything right, easily living up to its title, hard as that may be to believe. 



Rating: **18/20**



Cliff Severity: Yay stand-alone! 



5\. **Legendborn** by Tracy Deonn



Categories: Published in 2020 (hard), Ghost, School Setting, **Feminist (hard)**



Mini-Review: A Black teenager goes to college following the tragic death of her mother and finds a secret society of magic-users that trace their ancestry to King Arthur. And one of them seems to have it out for her. This hits a lot of the YA tropes, but it does them all so well that it makes them feel fresh. The plot is engaging, the character relationships feel real, and the legacy of racism on the contemporary storyline hits hard without feeling preachy. The flashback scenes in particular are exquisite. 



Rating: **18/20**



Cliff Severity: Resolves the major arcs, but introduces a fairly significant cliffhanger for a sequel hook. 



6\. **Orconomics** by J. Zachary Pike



Categories: Self-Published, **Necromancy**, Politics, Made You Laugh (hard)



Mini-Review: A satire of RPGs and Wall Street that starts out feeling clever but not especially memorable, and then about 75% of the way through, I realized that the D&amp;D archetypes had turned into real characters that I actually cared about. You wouldn’t think a comedy would hit like this emotionally, but it does. 



Rating: **17/20**



Cliff Severity: Resolves the major plot arcs, but leaves the door open for further action (and in such a way as to make it very difficult to not jump right into the sequel). 



7\. **Guards, Guards** by Terry Pratchett



Categories: **Made You Laugh**, Politics, Optimistic (hard)



Mini-Review: I guess I ranked the two comic fantasies next to each other. Guards, Guards is funnier than Orconomics, and it starts faster as well. This one hit more of a lull in the middle, but some of the individual scenes are absolutely hilarious. And the satire holds up decades later. 



Rating: **16/20**



Cliff Severity: Serves effectively as a stand-alone, although it leaves the door open for future adventures with the same cast (of which there are several, none of which I’ve read yet). 



8\. **Driftwood** by Marie Brennan



Categories: **Published in 2020**, Optimistic (hard), Climate, Politics



Mini-Review: This isn’t a cohesive narrative so much as five loosely-connected short stories in a common world. But a couple of the stores are really good (the second one would be one of my top shorts of the year had it been published separately), and the world is absolutely stunning. And at just 200 pages, it’s readable in an afternoon. 



Rating: **16/20**



Cliff Severity: This world is ripe for more stories, but this one resolves. 



9\. **Vita Nostra** by Marina and Sergey Dyachenko



Categories: **Translated**, School Setting (hard), Snow/Ice/Cold, Book Club



Mini-Review: A dark magic school that feels inspired by New Weird instead of Harry Potter. Often unsettling, always interesting. 



Rating: **16/20**



Cliff Severity: Yay stand-alone! 



10\. **Chasing Graves** by Ben Galley



Categories: Self-Published, **Ghost (hard)**, Necromancy, Politics



Mini-Review: A snarky lockpick who only looks out for himself arrives in a new city only to see himself killed and his ghost enslaved. Interesting world and a main character that sucks you in. Lots of intriguing setup, although the payoff will have to wait. 



Rating: **16/20**



Cliff Severity: Feels like the first third of a long book more than the first book of a trilogy. Maximal cliffhanging. 



11\. **Elatsoe** by Darcie Little Badger



Categories: Optimistic (hard), **Ace/Aro (hard)**, Feminist (hard), Published in 2020 (hard)



Mini-Review: A Lipan Apache teenager with an affinity for ghosts has to solve the mystery of her cousin’s murder and uncovers a lot more than she bargained for. Exciting throughout, dealing with strong anti-colonial themes and with the most wholesome and supportive friends and family that I’ve seen in YA fantasy. 



Rating: **16/20**



Cliff Severity: Stand-alone! 



12\. **The Lions of Al-Rassan** by Guy Gavriel Kay



Categories: **Canadian**, Politics, Book Club



Mini-Review: Heavy on the history and light on the fantastical elements, Kay creates a fantasy analogue of Moorish Spain, with major characters from three different ethnic and religious groups. It’s an intricate political fantasy that pulled me in from the start and quickly regained momentum after a lull in the middle. The length and subject may suggest a slow burn, but almost every chapter sees a hook that gives partial context and kept me reading on to get the full picture. Definitely as good as advertised. 



Rating: **16/20**



Cliff Severity: Two stand-alone in a row, what is the world coming to?



13\. **A Deadly Education** by Naomi Novik



Categories: Published in 2020, **School Setting (hard)**



Mini-Review: A dark magic school that takes some of the plot holes of Harry Potter (why do the adults persist in sending children into such danger) and make them the entire plot. An utterly compelling lead with a powerful first-person voice has to battle monsters at the same time as her own affinity for dark magic and her lack of upper class pedigree. It doesn’t do everything right, but it’s never boring. 



Rating: **15/20**



Cliff Severity: Resolves the major storyline and then drops a very intriguing sequel hook right at the death. 



14\. **Ninefox Gambit** by Yoon Ha Lee



Categories: Politics, Ghost, **Number**, Book Club



Mini-Review: Really fascinating concepts—homicidal genius inhabits the brain of a straight-laced military lead, science/magic system that depends on group beliefs—and excellent character work undercut to some degree by a lot of technobabble that makes the lead look like a genius by confusing the reader. It’s a strong start to the trilogy but also doesn’t quite reach its potential. 



Rating: **15/20**



Cliff-Severity: Resolves the immediate storyline but in such a way that opens up more story than it resolves. 



15\. **Leviathan Wakes** by James S.A. Corey



Categories: **Big Dumb Object (hard)**, Politics (hard)



Mini-Review: A relentless space thriller with conspiracies and mysterious objects and everything else that keeps you turning the pages. Not sure it’s one that really sticks with me after I put it down, but it’s a fun read (and often ensemble casts take more than one book to really come into their own). 



Rating: **15/20**



Cliff Severity: Resolves the major plot arcs, but opens up a wide world that’s ready for more stories. 



16\. **Storm Front** by Jim Butcher



Categories: **Book Club**, Ghost



Mini-Review: An entertaining procedural that doesn’t make many mistakes but also doesn’t necessarily go above-and-beyond. If the series only gets better from here—as seems to be the reputation—it should be a good one. 



Rating: **14/20**



Cliff Severity: A procedural, so it resolves the story but with the expectation that there will be more stories. 



17\. **The Code of the Communer** by Kai Greenwood



Categories: Self-Published, Snow/Ice/Cold, **Exploration (hard)**, Big Dumb Object, Published in 2020 (hard)



Mini-Review: An atmospheric novel about a tribe of forest nomads who, facing a threat from hostile settlers, seek out the semi-mythical homeland of long-ago giants. Some of their debates about what was reality and what was myth felt a bit contrived, and not every character really clicked, but the writing was smooth and the tension of exploring new lands with unknown dangers was exemplary. 



Rating: **14/20**



Cliff Severity: Resolves the main arcs, but in a way that opens the door for future adventures. 



18\. **The Path of Flames** by Phil Tucker



Categories: Self-Published, **Snow/Ice/Cold**, Politics



Mini-Review: The first installment in a six-book epic, The Path of Flames sets up a fascinating world in which most of the main characters are fundamentally deceived about reality. The conflict in this book was enthralling, and trying to piece together which aspects of the world were real and which were misinformation has me very curious about the rest of the series. On the other hand, the main characters were bound tightly to fantasy archetypes, and I always felt like I was seeing them as mediated by the author’s voice instead of really getting into their heads. The strengths here are incredible, but the weaknesses are concerning moving forward. 



Rating: **14/20**



Cliff Severity: Clearly the first in an epic series—some of the storylines don’t even intersect in the first book. That said, there is an intermediate storyline that is introduced and resolved in an interesting and satisfying way. 



19\. **A Pale Light in the Black** by K.B. Wagers



Categories: Ace/Aro (hard), **Optimistic (hard)**, Color, Published in 2020



Mini-Review: A heartwarming found family story in space with a diverse and likable cast. The main mystery is pretty interesting but often takes a backseat to a futuristic sports competition with yields some nice training sequences but doesn’t hit the right beats in the competition. 



Rating: **14/20**



Cliff Severity: Storyline resolved, but introduces an ensemble cast that is sure to have more adventures. 



20\. **The Blood Tartan** by Raymond St. Elmo



Categories: Self-Published, Book Club, **Romantic**



Mini-Review: How do you review a Raymond St. Elmo novel? It has the trappings of urban fantasy in a 19th century setting, and it checks all the boxes for paranormal romance, but it’s nothing like you expect from either urban fantasy or paranormal romance. With a introspective and *extremely sane* lead character, it’s full of ruminations and digressions that revel in the joy of words. There is a plot, and it’s not especially hard to follow, but it takes a backseat to the individual passages. You have to be in the mood for this kind of story, but if you are, it’s excellent. 



Rating: **14/20**



Cliff Severity: A satisfying intermediate conclusion but with an overarching storyline left open. 



21\. **A Magical Inheritance** by Krista D. Ball



Categories: Self-Published, Canadian (hard), Feminist, **Book About Books**



Mini-Review: A unmarried woman rapidly approaching spinsterhood (I mean, she’s in Regency England and almost 30!) inherits her Uncle’s occult library and has to (1) sort through it all, and (2) keep her inheritance away from various men who feel entitled to it. It’s light on plot but has plenty of snappy dialogue from some very no-nonsense, opinionated women (and one husband with a few excellent cameos) who are hard not to love. 



Rating: **14/20**



Cliff Severity: Satisfying in its own right, but introduces a fun ensemble cast that will doubtless be worth revisiting. 



22\. **Draigon Weather** by Paige Christie



Categories: **Climate (hard)**, Feminist



Mini-Review: Splits the story between two major characters, a strong-willed girl in a society that wants women to keep silent (and, if they don’t, sacrifices them to the Draigons in exchange to ease punishing, unnatural droughts) and her childhood friend who aspires to become a Draigon-slayer to keep her safe. The former storyline hits quite a few more cliches than I’d like—clever girl in a sexist society forges her own path, finds a mysterious and eccentric mentor, is endangered by said sexist society, etc.—while the latter is an absolutely fascinating deconstruction of the “knight in shining armor” trope. Much like Tucker’s entry a few spaces above, this series feels like it could be absolutely fantastic if it builds on the strengths or nothing special if it’s undercut by the weaknesses. But through one book, it’s stuck in “liked it but didn’t love it.” 



Rating: **14/20**



Cliff Severity: Resolves significant arcs, but leaves major characters in uncertain positions that demand a sequel. 



23\. **The Emperor’s Soul** by Brandon Sanderson



Categories: Optimistic (hard), **Audiobook**



Mini-Review: I know Sanderson is much-loved here, and I promise, I really tried to give him an honest chance, but I probably won’t be reading more. A black market soul forger is pressed into service to help cover up a grievous injury to the emperor. The magic system is interesting, and the story is likable enough, but this is one of those that you enjoy while you read and then totally forget when it’s over.



Rating: **14/20**



Cliff Severity: Stand-alone, except for the whole Cosmere thing. 




24\. **The Black Company** by Glen Cook



Categories: **Color**, Politics, Book Club



Mini-Review: Follows a mercenary company through a very episodic series of jobs. It did get a bit of overarching plot towards the end, but one book was not enough to really invest in the purportedly stellar ensemble cast, and the plot wasn’t enough to hook me. There were some hints of building blocks towards the series that has the kind of reputation that this one does, but not enough to really be excited about book one. 



Rating: **13/20**



Cliff Severity: Doesn’t necessarily have an overarching plot arc, but resolves some smaller arcs and opens up a broader storyline for the following books. 



25\. **Sabriel** by Garth Nix



Categories: **Magical Pet (hard)**



Mini-Review: A teenage girl just coming to mastery of her magical ability is sent on a journey through hostile country to save her father. I know this one’s beloved, and I can see why the damsel-in-distress subversion draws people in (here, it’s the damsel who has to save a mage in distress), but it felt mostly like Sabriel and her snarky cat companion getting dragged along by the plot—she never really gets to be more than reactive. 



Rating: **13/20**



Cliff Severity: Resolves main storyline, works effectively as a stand-alone, despite other works in this world. 

If you want a little bit of context on my ratings, 18 is my standard five-star rating and 15 is my standard four-star.

## Novel Featuring a Ghost

### Cemetery Boys by Aiden Thomas

**Hard Mode**: It’s complicated, but I’d say yes, at least in spirit (heh)

Cemetery Boys follows Yadriel, a young trans man who wants to become a  brujo like the other men in his family, but is held back by the fact  that they don’t see him as a “real” man. When a member of his family is  brutally murdered, Yadriel is determined to solve the mystery and prove  his magic. Unfortunately, he summons the “wrong” ghost, and things get  complicated from there. This book was thoroughly enjoyable, and I really  enjoyed reading about Latinx culture in Los Angeles from an own-voices  perspective. I am thoroughly unqualified to say if it was an accurate  representation of brujeria, which is a real religious practice, but the  fantasy magic system presented here was intriguing and engaging. I did  predict the main plot twist fairly early on, but I don’t think that’s  necessarily a bad thing, it just means it was well foreshadowed.

## Novel Featuring Exploration

### To Be Taught, if Fortunate by Becky Chambers

**Hard Mode**: Yes!

This novella about intrepid space explorers is likely to be a popular  choice for the exploration bingo square, and I’m no exception. This  story explores a lot of the themes that are common in space exploration  stories, like time dilation and cryogenic sleep and the grim knowledge  that the explorers will never see their friends or family again. But it  also explores the ethics of space exploration and what rights we have as  humans, if any, to intrude on worlds not our own. I really liked the  introduction of a crowd-funded space program. The ways in which the  characters modified themselves to fit the planets’ environs, instead of  the other way around, was also delightful and refreshing. The planets  they visited ranged from beautiful and vibrant to dreary and depressing,  but all were compelling to read about. While reading this book in  quarantine, the characters get stuck for several months on a rainy slug  planet. I related to them immensely. 

Unfortunately, while I enjoyed this book while I was reading it, I  found the ending fell short and soured the whole experience for me. A  mystery is introduced early on, and while I accept that it was a valid  artistic choice not to reveal the answer, as a reader I found it deeply  unsatisfying. Furthermore, without getting too far into spoiler  territory, the main character’s overwhelming decision paralysis as to  whether or not space exploration is ethical is brought to the least  interesting conclusion possible, with the protagonist … deciding to  continue not to decide. Honestly this book felt very much like a  novella-length apology on the author’s part for liking space exploration  at all, and as such, was a bit of a disappointing read.

## Climate Fiction

### All the Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders

**Hard Mode**: Yes

As the world is torn apart by climate change, witches and mad  scientists alike vie to save it the best ways they know how — but both  sides may end up destroying the world instead. Childhood friends  Patricia and Lawrence find themselves on opposite sides, but they might  also be in love with each other too. This book did a lot of things  really well, including the heart rending depiction of what it is like to  be a nerdy outcast growing up, and how even nerdy children sometimes  betray each other in order to fit in, and how the relationship can heal  from that betrayal. I felt the second half when they were adults was  just a little too rushed, however, and would have liked to see more of  both the climate aspect, and life in the Witch and Mad Scientist camps. I  also feel like the narrative does a lot to explain why both the witches  and mad scientists are Wrong, but doesn’t really offer any useful  alternatives. Still a good read, with excellent characters.

## Novel with a Colour in the Title

### The House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune

**Hard Mode**: yep!

If any book can be described as “delightful,” it is definitely this  one. It is at its core a story about found family and the search for  home. It reaches out to what I am going to guess is a lot of us, people  who are sad and lonely adults working our boring bureaucratic jobs who  wish to recapture the wonder of Harry Potter getting his Hogwarts letter  under the stairs. Except better because TJ Klune isn’t a TERF. I hope.  There are times when the book veers toward the absurdist and saccharine,  and the whole thing with Extremely Upper Management felt more like a  parody than part of a real, lived-in world, and if you’re after the  grimmest of grimdark this is probably not the book for you. But if you  want what feels like the equivalent of a hug in book form, this is the  book for you.

## Any r/fantasy Book Club Book or Read-Along

### Half a Soul by Olivia Atwater

**Hard Mode**: Sorry, no :( This was the Happily Ever After book club entry for February 2021, but alas, I missed out on the discussion

Optimistic, joyful books seem to the be the theme of the day for the  second row of Bingo, and this one is no exception. Once rebellious and  gregarious, Dora lost half of her soul to a fae lord when she was a  child. As a result she comes across as cold and emotionless, but as the  reader finds out getting to know her, that isn’t the case at all. Having  half of a soul, it turns out, does not make one any less of a person. I  liked how relatable the character of Dora was, as someone who myself is  a bit awkward and sometimes reacts to things the “wrong” way. The side  characters were pretty delightful as well, except for the ones we are  obviously supposed to dislike. I liked the take on fae in this story as  well. They are of the sinister/terrifying variety, but in a way that is  inhuman and alien instead of actively malicious, which in a way makes  them even more dangerous.

389,Fantasy,Review - The Queen of Ieflaria,"Since I seem to keep banging on about this book in recs lately, I thought I would share a full review.

Esofi has been preparing for her marriage to Prince Albion of Ieflaria since she was three to benefit their kingdoms, but now the prince has died, she remains committed to the arrangement between the kingdoms and agrees to marry the next in line for the crown. Princess Adale is next in line, but no one seems too sure she is ready or willing, after spending her life wild and free, her favorite pastimes hunting and drinking. Ieflaria has no time to wait for their princess to make up her mind, ever increasing dragon attacks demand the assistance of the battlemages Esofi brings from Rhodion, so their safety in the balance if Adale won't marry then the well prepared royal cousins are ready to jump at the opportunity. There is a whole pantheon of gods not just in these kingdoms but Elven kingdoms have their own gods, Ieflaria is facing a drought of magic though it seems the gods are involved, and no one knows why the dragon attacks are increasing. Of course, Adale ends up showing Esofi around the city, eventually they start delving into the libraries to research dragons together and get to know one another more.

I'm sure I first heard about this from Jean's Bookish Thoughts, went in kind of expecting just a light fluffy romance without much else, happily it exceeded my expectations. The characters are all so empathetic (well, except the twins) and really have layers, we get both Esofi and Adale's perspectives, seeing their internal insecurities about the new situation they are in. It's interesting Esofi is a fish out of water in terms of appearance and style, alone in a new kingdom, yet she has all this power over the future of the kingdom, is thoroughly trained to rule and adept at magic, so I really enjoyed reading this extremely competent character who still has some vulnerability.

I think the only downside to this is really that I just wanted MORE everything. The romance was sweet (Note: no steam though, this goes no further than kissing) and the way they get to know each other felt like a realistic relationship, even while its built around magic and magical beasts, but there were some periods where the chemistry was paused for plot. Other times I wanted to go so much deeper into the worldbuilding, like we know how many god there are, but don't learn about all of them, or the history of magical beasts and dragon lore, even references to a third gender (or maybe genderless) identity in their culture. We do get a lot for as short as this book is, so I'm definitely looking forward to continuing on in the series hoping it expands those areas I was looking for more.

As well, for those fans of Chauncy from House in the Cerulean Sea &gt;!at the very end there is a baby dragon, that gave me serious Chauncy vibes, I really hope it is in other books!&lt;"

391,Fantasy,The r/Fantasy Top Books by Women: 2021 Edition,"Hi everyone! It's time for another of r/Fantasy's big lists!

The theme this time round is books by women. Who have you been reading? What's new that you've loved? Have an oldie that you want to shine the light on? Step right up, all are fair game.

Okay, on to everyone's favorite part (no, just me?)... the rules!

**1. Make a list of YOUR top TEN favorite books/series by women in a new post in this thread**

Just post your top ten series or individual books. If the book is *part* of a series, then we'll count is *as* the series. For example, if The Stone Sky is your favorite Broken Earth novel, it'll be a vote for *The Broken Earth*, so please try and list the series title. If the book is standalone, (for example *Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell* by Susanna Clarke), it'll be listed by itself.

**2. Only one book from any single series, please, with a few exceptions**

Everything in the same world will get one entry. Realm of the Elderlings, Inda, The Dark is Rising, Wars of Light and Shadow, Rai-Kirah, Earthsea... you get the idea.

Books that are only barely set on the same world won't be clumped together, for instance things like The Lions of Al-Rassan and The Sarantine Mosaic.

That said, in the end I'll be deciding on a per-case basis, [though the previous list is a good guide for what things will be clumped together.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/cp4lls/rfantasys_top_female_authored_seriesbooks_2019/)

**3. Please format your voting posts correctly.**

The votes will be tallied with a script, so proper formatting is especially important to ensure it all goes smoothly. Incorrectly formatted votes **will not count**. I am going to be lenient with warnings and will help you fix it, but ultimately your vote is your responsibility.

To format correctly:

* **Put each vote on a new line.** To do so, keep a blank line between every vote OR put two spaces before pressing enter. Making it a bulleted list is fine and likely easiest if you're using New Reddit.
* **Format your vote as Title by Author or as Title - Author.** If unsure, please look at how most do it. Italics or bolding should be perfectly fine. Common mistakes are putting the author first, listing just the story name, omitting the ""-"" or ""by"" separator...please do not do that or your vote will not be counted.
* **PLEASE take the time to make sure you've spelled the title and author name correctly.** Every spelling mistake adds a day to the results being posted.
* **Please leave all commentary and discussion for the discussion posts under each original post.** In your voting comment, just list your top ten (or fewer than ten). It'll make it far easier to compile data if the original posts are only votes. However, you can reply to voting comments with all the arguments and discussion you want!

**4. Upvotes/downvotes will have no effect on the tally**

Feel free to upvote and downvote as you like, especially if someone has a great list. That being said, I decided to go with the ""top ten"" instead of the upvote/downvote voting for several reasons: You only have to vote once, you don't have to revisit the thread over and over to vote on new arrivals, you can vote once in just a few minutes as opposed to scrolling through a mammoth thread, etc.

I've also popped the thread in contest mode, as I'm a fan of it.

**5. Voting info**

Each item you list will count as one vote toward that book or series. Duplicate books will not be counted. We'll also not be counting books Coauthored by men and women; aka Kate Daniels by Ilona Andrews, and The Empire Series by Janny Wurts and Raymond E Fiest.

**6. All Speculative Fiction is fair game!**

Once again, all spec-fic is fair game. Fantasy, science fiction, horror, historical fiction, I'm not picky. If you love it, vote for it.

**7. The voting will run for exactly one week**

Seven days should be enough time for people to edit votes if they forgot a series they loved, and also allow the lurkers (hello lurkers! we love you!) that only visit once every few days time to vote.

**So vote! Discuss!**"
392,Fantasy,Book Review: Parable of the Sower by Octavia E. Butler,"Los Angeles, 2024. The United States is dying a slow death. Law and order is confined to isolated, walled-off communities and city centres. The suburbs are warzones of inequality and crime, subject to warlords and corporate exploitation. Police and ambulances won't leave protected areas without hefty fees. Rising sea levels are swamping coastal communities. One community on the outskirts of the city has become a haven of kindness and safety, a refuge founded by a preacher who wants to protect his family and neighbours. His daughter, Lauren Oya Olamina, a ""sharer"" who can feel other people's pain and suffering, making her empathetic to their needs. When their safe haven is no longer safe, the inhabitants have to consider a dangerous journey to try to escape.

*Parable of the Sower* was originally published in 1993 and has become a widely-acknowledged classic of science fiction. Inhabiting a similar space to Margaret Atwood's *The Handmaid's Tale*, it describes the collapse of the United States. Unlike that novel, the cause is not infertility, fascism or religious fundamentalism, but apparently simple overload. The country is no longer able to cope with the assaults on its foundations from multiple directions and it flounders and sinks, almost permitting a decline and an assault from within and without on its values. There are echoes of the fall of the Roman Empire here, with the idea of such a mighty superpower laid low not by a headline-leading single event, but the accumulation of lots of small issues over decades.

The novel's success is not in presenting this collapse - a quiet apocalypse - as a spectacle, but as background to the everyday life of its protagonist. Lauren is concerned about the big picture of how events are falling out and has a dream about how to confront it, but is more consumed by day-to-day life in her community. She and her friends can only go out in groups where some of them are armed, and maintaining supplies of food, water and essentials is difficult against a backdrop of seeming governmental indifference to the spreading chaos. The attention to detail is superb, with Butler painting Lauren's life as one under extreme pressure but under which life continues: she has boyfriends, she has friendships and she maintains her family relationships despite the dangers of the world around them.

Later in the book the story shifts to a road trip where parallels to post-apocalyptic stories like *The Road* and even **The Walking Dead** can be made, but all the more powerful here because there isn't a supernatural horror stalking the characters or some vague massive holocaust. Instead it's just people, people who have broken the world and other people wanting to put it back together and others who want to build something better, something new and enduring. Strangers are to be treated with caution, as some are dangerous and only want to rob or harm you; others are good people who just need a reason to show their good side.

Butler's prose is poetic and raw, capturing the mood and thoughts of a teenage girl frustrated by the world, one who uniquely understands its pain because she can feel it in the thoughts of other people. Her grasp of characterisation is strong, with each character painted vividly through Lauren's eyes, sometimes wrongly, with early impressions that a character might be trouble or a hero later shown to be the reverse of what is actually the case.

The book's strength might be its tone and suggestion that things might actually just fall apart due to pressure. There might not be an asteroid strike, or a nuclear war, or a global pandemic to bring things crashing down, it might just be that the collective will to make a society work fails. But there's also a line of hope running through the novel, a note of hope, that people can better than they sometimes are, and humanity is, for all its flaws, worthy of being saved.

*Parable of the Sower* (\*\*\*\*\*) is a rich and compelling novel from one of science fiction's master voices. It is available in the UK and USA now. A sequel, *Parable of the Talents*, was published in 1998."
393,Fantasy,[Review] Darkness Forged by Matt Larkin (SPFBO),"I read this for SPFBO -my review only.  Links to team reviews and other information at the bottom.

\-

I was glad to see this author in the finals- not because I have read anything by him before but because I haven’t. I’ve been seeing his books around for awhile and have been curious about them.

\*\*\*

I loved the writing style right off. I thought the narration was well-suited to the story that it was telling; it gave me the impression I was reading a very dark folktale before I even knew it was based off one.

This story itself did take awhile for me to settle in to. It seemed like I was kind of waiting to see where it was going to go because it felt like a bigger story than the page count was going to allow. Maybe familiarity with the source (or Norse legends in general) would have helped with that too, I don’t know. As the tale unfolded and we started seeing some of the past events- especially Volund’s time with the Dverg, the story got a lot more interesting to me and I was hooked.

I actually really enjoyed this, despite how dark it was in places. I think though, I do tend to give a little leeway in my likes, to myth/folk retellings just because they are usually rather bleak. There’s a lesson to be taught in them and rarely does the lesson-learned have a good outcome for the characters.

I don’t know if that was an author’s choice or if the tale was originally that way, but in true to folktale fashion, this story gave us a look at every outcome of the brother’ choices- which I thought was cool.

I did wish that the other brothers pov were expanded on just to fill/balance out their povs a little more-probably my only real gripe. Now I know this story was based on a folktale, I understand why they weren’t.

Great storytelling- really enjoyed this one.

Furthermore, I'm making the ebook of the first Nowak Brothers book, [I Kill Monsters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RPK225O), free for the next few days!

I live in the town of Pflugerville, Texas, perched at the edges of Austin so that we might better scavenge its leavings. I've spent a good amount of my non-writing career in the game industry telling people how they're wrong plus other assorted techie tasks. I'm a huge fan of libraries, video games, board games, music, and assorted geekery. I can expound on a variety of topics that are inane, unimportant, subversive, overthought, or all of these consecutively or concurrently. I keep more opinions to myself than I probably should. I am a lifelong Scooby Doo devotee, a SMT/Persona aficionado, a meditation enthusiast, a mythology buff, and somehow I am also a parent.

Now, let's talk ridiculous moments. We often talk about our desires for serious, believable SFF stories. But then when we reminisce, it becomes apparent that often our favorite moments are the ones that are implausible, unbelievable, even downright ridiculous. They wouldn't likely happen in real life, because of course these are stories - important things happen like that because they were woven that way - designed that way - for entertainment and to invoke that wonderful reaction you had.  Many of these situations are objectively dumb if you weren't caught up in the moment: a giant ape holding a woman batting at planes from the top of a building? A single fighter shooting one missile in a vent destroying an enormous space station? A hero chased down by a perfectly round boulder while setting off century old traps that still work? The hero convincing the mass murdering villain to stop their grand plan at the moment just before completion by having a simple philosophical conversation or reminding them of their loved ones? A giant robot hitting a giant monster with a boat? A man able to build a battlesuit from spare parts but not able to fix the pain in his heart? Magical beings returning to life simply because we clapped? Yet despite how outlandish the might appear externally, we were all there in those moments. Some part of us whispered that it wasn't realistic, but a louder voice shouted, ""Fuck yeah!"" And we had that smile - that involuntary grin when we're experiencing something unexpectedly awesome.

What are your favorite moments of SFF in any medium that were memorable and great, despite being implausible, impossible, or ridiculous? Or, what are your favorite moments that were great because they were completely ridiculous and over the top?
Here is [one of my favorite ridiculous moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_plih5b9To), made so much better by the fact that it is SO beyond anything reasonable, and it keeps getting more stupid/awesome the longer it continues. Like many of my favorite moments, I am disappointed I had nothing to do with creating it.

One last question: Did you clap?"

So i was wondering if you guys could recommand some fantasy books about a badass couple (bonus if they are fighters or killers).

When i say couple i do mean COUPLE. I’m not interested in reading about two people meeting and falling in love. To be honest i’m particularly interested in the « romance » part. Simply two people who love each other and do badass things together. 

Actually, even better if they are in an open relationship, but obviously it’s perfectly okay if they’re not, i doubt there are many of those couples in fantasy yet, maybe it will come.

403,Fantasy,I have a lot of trouble with character motivation. Does anyone else? Do you have any tips?,"I've found while reading that one particular thing tends to elude me a lot, and that is understanding a character's motives. This isn't all the time, but enough to be noticeable. Unfortunately I can only think of one example at the moment - it is in the Farseer Trilogy, book 1, and I will spoil tag as necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Fitz is told by his trainer, Hod, to steal from King Shrewd. Fitz refuses and is thrown out of training, or so it seems. It is ultimately revealed that this was a test of Fitz' loyalty and he passed by refusing to steal, but then he steals a knife from Shrewd anyway, blatantly in front of Shrewd, and stabs it above Hod's fireplace.!&lt;

I... didn't get it. Not one bit. What happened there? Why did Fitz do that? What did it accomplish? I read the section several times over and could not make heads or tails of it. I actually came here to ask, and at least one person more or less bluntly said ""You obviously weren't paying attention, read it again."" Other responses were more helpful, thankfully, but I still didn't get the impression of what they were saying from the text. I had similar issues with the Broken Empire trilogy, though I don't have any examples off the top of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this may have something to do with being on the spectrum - I try not to use that fact as justification for any idiosyncrasies I have but it seems possible. Does anyone have tips for understanding what characters are thinking and feeling more intently, or at least has anyone else found themselves with a similar experience before?"

If you're not comfortable with that, hit the back arrow. If you are, read on…

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d7kwno5h6pm61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e0cf129b321005eb109f87f9933896018b6c1c

Several of the books I read for Bingo have this in common: they use multiple points of view happening at multiple points in time to tell their stories. There have already been a lot of reviews of these books, so I thought I'd do something different and discuss them all together, concentrating on that particular aspect.

The four books are N. K. Jemisin's *The Fifth Season* (book 1 of the Broken Earth trilogy), Emily St. John Mandel's *Station Eleven*, Annalee Newitz's *The Future of Another Timeline* and Adrian Tchaikovsky's *Children of Ruin* (the sequel to *Children of Time*)*.*

In *The Fifth Season,* time is as fractured as the landscape. We have three POV characters: Essun, Damaya and Syenite. At first it's not clear what is happening when, but as the book progresses it becomes obvious that the three parts of the story are taking place at different times. Eventually, we see how the three are connected: separate shards of story that reflect a central narrative, each from a different angle.

Jemisin handles this brilliantly. She doesn't make a big deal about it. The hints are there, but it's the reader that has to do the work. It's extremely satisfying to piece it together.

Everything from each narrative thread feels pertinent; nothing is out of place or extraneous. The tension between the different threads - and the way they eventually converge - is captivating.

*The Fifth Season* is very much volume one of a larger work, rather than a standalone with sequels; we don't get everything tied up neatly in a bow. The end of the book is more like an indrawn breath of anticipation than a satisfied sigh. But that's just in terms of the plot. There's another arc: the structure. And the payoff is excellent.

I expect it's better to read the whole trilogy back to back, and if I wasn't doing Bingo I would have moved on to the second book in the series immediately.

Emily St. John Mandel's apocalypse novel *Station Eleven* has five viewpoint characters - Jeevan, Arthur, Clark, Kirsten and Miranda - and we dip into various times in the lives of each one. The narrative passes from person to person like a virus, and it oscillates back and forth across the central catastrophic event. There are scenes from after, just before, long before, and during the catastrophe.

In some scenes characters reminisce about earlier times. Arthur thinks of his teenage years, him and his best friend Clark both trying to get started in the world. We pass over to Clark for a bit of his perspective, then forward to his time immediately after the catastrophe, then immediately before, then much later. We see an event play out in detail from Miranda's perspective in all its emotional intensity, later get a brief nostalgic, regretful mention of it from Arthur, and much later a dim memory of it from Clark - boredom, shame, longing, disgust, regret, all coming from the same source.

Perspective is important to the book, as is contradiction. A person can be both jaded and clueless, washed up and with a bright future ahead of them, civilised and brutal. It all depends on the context, the angle, the distance. From a post-apocalyptic perspective, our time - with its mobile phones, air-conditioning, planes and the internet - is a science-fiction wonderland, an impossible dream.

&gt;""I remember how you could open a fridge, and cold air and light would spill out. …they had light inside as well as cold, right? I'm not just imagining this?""

Even more so than in *The Fifth Season,* the narrative threads of *Station Eleven* never quite braid together, although they do get tangled around each other occasionally. Each of the main five characters interacts with all, or all but one, of the other four. Certain objects travel between characters. There's an intimacy to these entanglements: the sense of a shared journey, even when everybody travels by different paths. The timelines overlap, ricochet off one another, influence each other from afar or from long ago.

This intricate, intertwining plotting is masterful, as is the prose.

&gt;In the morning light there was beauty in the decrepitude, sunlight catching in the flowers that had sprung up through the gravel of long-overgrown driveways, mossy front porches turned brilliant green, a white blossoming bush alive with butterflies. This dazzling world. An ache in Kirsten's throat. The houses thinned out, longer spaces between the overgrown driveways, and now the right lane of the road was clogged with cars, rusted exoskeletons on flat tires. When she glanced in the windows, she saw only trash from the old world, crumpled chip bags, the remains of pizza boxes, electronic objects with buttons and screens.

In *Station Eleven* the past is another world. A massive upheaval has rendered it inaccessible, even incomprehensible. In *The Fifth Season* it's the same world from another perspective, but a change is coming.

In Annalee Newitz's *The Future of Another Timeline*, the past is another country - one you can visit. Change is possible, but the outcome is uncertain.

There are two main viewpoints: Beth, a teenager in 1993, and Tess, a middle-aged woman from 2022. Tess visits 1993, when she herself was a teenager, as well as 1893 and earlier times. She's part of a group of women attempting to edit the past in order to avoid a future where women are second-class citizens. At every turn they're opposed by fascist chauvinist time travellers with the opposite agenda: they want to subjugate women forever, and destroy the time machines so it can't be undone.

Tess also keeps going off-mission and attempting to change the past in more personal ways. Beth meanwhile, or otherwhile, is trying to define herself and make the world make sense in the normal teenage way. There are a couple of other POVs sprinkled in, but they mostly serve to tell one of the two main storylines from another perspective, or to link the two together in some way.

The character arc, narrative tension, and intricate plotting of Tess's storyline are great, although I wasn't entirely convinced by the very end. (The main climax of the story is good; what I'm talking about is more of a postscript to that, so don't let me put you off.) Unfortunately, Beth's storyline isn't as compelling and the payoff isn't satisfying. Her sections aren't without merit though; there is most of a good story there. Her group of friends have big Celebrity Stealing Club energy, which I enjoyed, and the backdrop of the early 90s LA punk scene is exactly my cup of tea.

The catastrophe in *TFOAT* isn't a certainty, only a looming possibility. The way it's fought against provides metaphorical instructions for our own lives: small changes can have momentous impact, so attack the injustices around you and gradually we will make a better world; our pasts must be constantly revisited, redefined, and atoned for in order to make the present bearable and the future better.

It's a resolutely feminist book with a rousingly positive message, but there is a dark side to it. There is some quite gory violence, as well as sexual assault and child molestation. Unlike some stories, this book addresses the after-effects of such things, but the things are very much there.

In Adrian Tchaikovsky's *Children of Ruin* things are a little different. The POVs jump around between a spaceship's mixed crew of humans and intelligent spiders, who have arrived at a new solar system after following a human signal; the humans far in the past who were responsible for the signal; some intelligent octopuses, past and present; and some incomprehensible aliens that none of them quite know how to deal with.

It's all a bit of a jumble.

Time is badly mishandled in this book. Tchaikovsky often kills the narrative momentum by jumping back in time from a cliffhanger to a boring episode from the past. Groups of characters spend long, slow periods travelling. There is far too much explaining and pontificating, and not nearly enough action.

The past timeframe influences the future timeframe, but there is no intimacy to the connection. No one lives through the intervening events, there's just an enormous gulf of numb time. The causal connections are factual, not emotional.

Perhaps it's because the book isn't about coming to terms with one's self and one's past. It's about coming to terms with other people, having to reconcile their frustratingly different worldviews and psychologies with our own, and the urgent need for collaboration if we're all to be saved.

Which is fine, but that's exactly what the preceding book, *Children of Time*, was about as well, only done much better. The sequel feels redundant.

*Children of Time* had a lot of focus on the spiders as they evolved and developed a complex society, with [many memorable scenes](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/lhihoq/what_was_your_favourite_part_of_children_of_time/). *Children of Ruin*, by contrast, never delves deep enough into the octopuses. There's a lot of stuff about the guy that bred them, but it's a long time before we get to the octopus society proper, and once we're there it's not that exciting.

There are a bunch of different ways nonlinear storytelling can be used, and it's nice to see all these authors doing it their own way, even if the results are mixed.

*Station Eleven*'s approach works best for me, because it's so rooted in the characters. Every jump in time sheds new light on a person; it's not just a way of eventually building to a climax from multiple angles.

*The Future of Another Timeline* is more linear (from the characters' perspectives, at least) and more plot-focused, but again time jumps with the story, not against it.

*Children of Ruin* flops in that regard. The time jumps work against the story, muddling things and disrupting the pace, and there just isn't enough emotional depth or personal connection between the timeframes to carry it.

*The Fifth Season* succeeds in a different way: we don't know we're jumping around in time. The jumps feel lateral to the story, and although we know it's all going to come together in the end, it isn't clear how. The jumps are well timed, and each POV's story is so compelling that the pace is never disrupted; there's always a forward momentum and always, always tension."
410,Fantasy,"PC Hodgell's God Stalk series, and other Dark Fantasy","I read a few of these books when I was a teen and have been looking to get back into them. They're a weird dark fantasy with a really unique feel to them.

But for those of you who have read these - how many books will there be in the series? I saw book 8 came out two years ago. I can't seem to find this info anywhere and Hodgell herself seems to make few public statements. How do the other books in the series compare to the earliest couple books?

And if anyone can recommend other Dark Fantasy books like this - I'm looking through Scott Lynch and R Scott Bakker now - I'm really looking for good Dark Fantasy published in the last two years. Goodreads seems to only give me women's dark fantasy romance novels...yikes. I'm open to anything Dark Fantasy, even if it blends genres into slipstream or science fantasy (like Wolfe). But it's very difficult finding stuff very recently published. I'd like to know where this genre is headed."

And I have to say, this one of my favorite fantasy works EVER.  One can humanize a God because a God is known for his humane nature. 

But it is hard to humanize a demonic character, to give him layers of insight, to prove to be greater than he was held. And those who have achieved this fall into the most talented category of modern writers, and Amish Tripathi has mastered that.

And masterfully told, masterfully crafted, there are things told which to undermine our importance but not the books.  One of the best books that I have read in a  long time. And the credit goes to the brilliance of the author. 

 I have always been interested in Hindu Mythology and being from a religious Hindu family I have grown up listening to Mythology.  

Amish Tripathi has created his own brand of book writing in India. He has dealt with religious and mythological characters hitherto considered too holy to touch or too dull to write about.

He provides a fresh religious perspective to his readers. He introduces them to a God that is very different from what they have been taught about…a God that can fail, a God that can doubt, a God who is human, and above all, a God that can be approached and related with. Not just that, his descriptions of action sequences, temple architecture, and even everyday life is ethereal and intricate and a pure joy to read.

https://preview.redd.it/nq7ncey7rom61.png?width=184&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74803b85e8fa37ad29abc56a1c3aa0340b306f64

To me, his works are timeless. Their philosophy will be just as relevant 100 years later as it is today.

Do read his works, and in sequence. You will be amazed. He is one of the best contemporary Indian authors.

NOTE: I am not saying this to shove my culture into people's faces, this a genuinely good book, and its purpose is not to glorify Hinduism"
413,Fantasy,"Cover Reveal for C.S. Pacat's DARK RISE, out in September!",
414,Fantasy,Can anyone recommend me serious Manga with beautiful prose?,"I know of many books with beautiful prose (the Raven Cycle, the Broken Earth Trilogy, Tanith Lee's books) and one visual novel (the House in Fata Morgana). One of my favorite passages is the opening to the Raven King. It's part of the free extract on amazon and only 2 pages long, and is a perfect example of what I'm looking for, beautiful prose that has a poetic rhythm: [https://www.amazon.com/Raven-King-Cycle-Book/dp/0545424984](https://www.amazon.com/Raven-King-Cycle-Book/dp/0545424984). I'm looking for a manga or webcomic that does the same.

The best example I know of is from volume 12 of Seraph of the End, when Ferid reveals a central plot point that happened before the start of the story. The monologue goes like this (major spoilers until volume 12):

\&gt;!Ferid: He is haunted...!&lt; &gt;!....by his friends.!&lt;

\&gt;!All his precious companions....!&lt; &gt;!...and their deaths.!&lt;

\&gt;!Yuu: What do you mean...?!&lt;

\&gt;!Ferid: Eight years ago...!&lt; &gt;!...he had friends he cared about very much.!&lt;

\&gt;!Friends he would give his life for.!&lt;&gt;!Their names were...!&lt;

\&gt;!Shinya Hiragi.!&lt;

\&gt;!Norito Goshi.!&lt;

\&gt;!Mito Jujo.!&lt;

\&gt;!Sayori Hanayori.!&lt;

\&gt;!Shigure Yukimi.!&lt;

\&gt;!But they all died.!&lt;

\&gt;!Shinoa: What?! W-wait a minute...!&lt; &gt;!That can't be right.!&lt;

\&gt;!Ferid: Oh, they died all right.!&lt; &gt;!And then they were revived.!&lt;

\&gt;!But the world does not permit the dead to come back to life.!&lt; &gt;!It was a presumption that angered a petty god.!&lt;

\&gt;!The price of their return was great.!&lt; &gt;!Very, very great.!&lt;

\&gt;!Can you guess what it was?!&lt;

\&gt;!All the adult humans of the world were killed by a virus.!&lt;

\&gt;!Ever since, Guren Ichinose...!&lt; &gt;!...has been haunted by that sin and its price.!&lt;

Not only is the prose beautiful, **it is combined with the art in a very artistic and poetic way.** While Ferid is monologuing, the art shows his and the others' faces and expressions, but when he talks about the world, the art shows a birdseye view of a city, and when he starts listing the names of the people who died, they are each written in a separate word bubble on the same panel, which shows just a black background. The reader and the characters listening to him don't yet know that these people are dead (it's revealed in the next panel) so it acts as subtle foreshadowing. **A lot of manga tend to go for the equivalent of 'glass prose' that doesn't draw attention to itself with panel placement, but I'm looking for manga that make them go together to make something poetic. There's a rhythm to the words and how they go with the images in the same way that books like the Lord of the Rings, the Raven Cycle, and the Broken Earth Trilogy have rhythm.** It's not as clear with just the text present, because the position of the text bubbles in relation to each other is central to the rhythm e.g. a blank panel with no text is used to create pauses. Here I started a new line with each new word bubble, except for connected word bubbles, which are on the same line but with a space between spoiler tags.

The main issue with Seraph of the End is that this 'poeticness' only occurs at certain rare points in the story, and I'm looking for a manga/webcomic where it's more common. 

Another example is Annarasumanara, a free webcomic on Webtoon about a poor Korean girl who meets a magician who claims he can do real magic. Here the poeticness is much more prevalent. The comic is full of monologues by the main character about her feelings about her situation and the possibility of magic existing. The prose isn't as beautiful as the previous 2 examples, but I get the impression it's a result of the translation (which is by no means bad, but there are places the prose *feels* translated).

As an example of what I'm looking for, chapter 3 starts like this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n708rcsz6om61.jpg?width=349&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59da92b7258d2faaf3ef9ff8aead216c5b99029a

During that chapter, the protagonist arrives home to find her father's debt collectors have come to get some money, but she doesn't have any. The magician appears and creates money from thin air, but it's fake and the debt collectors beat him up and leave. This is how the chapter ends:

415,Fantasy,Shadow of the Conqueror is bad and kind of hilarious,"*Disclaimer: I love Shad. This is sad. This review pains me to my soul. Please forgive me.*  

**Warning: Spoilers for *Shadow of the Conqueror* by Shad M. Brooks** 

I loved the premise of this book, because I'm kind of fucked up like that and love villain protagonists. It may sound weird, but a former dictator trying to mend his ways is my cup of tea with cream on top. So I was positively biased towards this book. 

I couldn't even finish it. I think I went about 100 pages in before giving up and just skimming through the rest of it. 

I think many people, especially on Youtube, were afraid to bash this book simply because of the author. And I get it. Shadiversity is great and nice and loves his machiculations. I like him. I'm rooting for him in his next projects. But this book NEEDS bashing. It needs some *quality* bashing, from a person who's good at this sort of thing. I'm not, so here are some of my very disjointed thoughts. 

# The Prose 

...is really awkward and unprofessional. This is the first, immediate clue that shit is about to go down. The awkward sentences, the modern vocab (every ""yeah"",  ""hey"" and ""uum"" in this book hurt my soul a little more), the over-explaining of things that don't need it. Overall, very unpolished writing that feels like a first draft. Self-publishing was a mistake in this case, me thinks. 

# The Angst 

The self-pity in this book is amazing. Daylen is an emotional child who needs a smack in the face. Crying and moping around for a third of the story is not a very likeable character trait, nor a great exploration of guilt. It is especially jarring seeing how he conviniently forgets said guilt just in time to violently kill someone. One of the most memorable things in the book is him *screaming himself to death* out of his own angst (he gets better cauz he's basically invinsible). 

# Unintentional Comedy 

The book starts with Daylen falling from a cliff in an attempt to commit suicide. Through some pretty complicated worldbuilding, the fall is so big he has time to do soul searching and come to multiple realizations during it. Y'all, this is cartoon level material. I'm pretty sure I've seen Will E Coyote do it at some point. I'm not sure if anyone else found this hilarious, but I sure did. 

Then we get more slapstick. He manages to cut of his legs and regrow them at some point, and did I mention that he screams himself to death? Yeah. I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to take these parts seriously or not. 

# No Character Development 

So Daylen used to be an unapologetic tyrant, murderer, and child rapist. Then he fakes his death and goes into hiding, and now he's renounced basically everything he ever did/believed in. We're never given insight on what made him change his mind and see the error in his ways. Even when confronted by his followers, he acts as if they are completely irrational for believing what HE taught them. 

He doesn't learn anything new throughout the book, either. He starts the book denouncing his beliefs and repentant, he ends the book the same way. He doesn't gain any new insight about the consequences of his actions, he doesn't get emotional growth, doesn't get anything really. 

# Mary Sue, Thy Name is Daylen 

Other than being very attractive (of course), this guy is basically so powerful with his newfound powers that no one is a match for him. Additionally, he is an expert swordsman, engineer, and tactician. There is no challenge and no suspense in any fight he has. 

# Daylen is a Moron

This was actually one of my biggest pet peeves. I hate when authors make their characters out to be geniuses at everything, and then *fail to show it*. Daylen is just dumb. He's supposed to be hiding his identity, yet he nearly reveals himself in the stupidest of ways (you know, such as USING THE SAME EXACT NAME). Thankfully, the other characters are stupid too, so they don't put two and two together. 

# The Sexual Stuff 

Some people were understandably bothered by the handling of rape in the novel. I wasn 't personally disturbed, probably because it doesn't even feel real. It's like a 12-year-old boy writing about sex; very clumsy and awkward. Shad is way to Mormon for this. It would have done much better for himself to just leave it alone. 

TLDR: This book is as badly written as this review, but at least it made me laugh."
416,Fantasy,Fantasy books that use Ancient Greece as an aesthetic template rather than Medieval Europe?,"Medieval Europe is nice and all, but are there any fantasy books that use Ancient Greece as an aesthetic instead? I've long been fascinated with Ancient Greece and all the mythology/folklore of that time. It seems like it would be ripe for fantasy. I'm not referring to historical fiction set in Ancient Greece, but fictional worlds that use it as a template rather than the typical Medieval Europe template."
417,Fantasy,Where can I good fantasy smut?,"I'm looking for a book that's passable without it, but has smut in it. I'm good with werewolf or a shifting, mate type thing. Having magic isn't a requirement but if they don't shift would be preferred"
418,Fantasy,Well-written prose &amp; other pie-in-the-sky wishes,"I'll start this by saying I know I'm picky. I blame this on authors. After reading excellent writers such a N. K. Jemisin I find it difficult to pick up just any book and read. 
Don't get me wrong I often do just that, pick up any fantasy book and read, but I walk away with that unsatisfied feeling of having eaten a McDonald's Quarter Pounder.
What do I want? Good prose, well-drawn characters, a decent plot line that's not full of tropes. Is that too much to ask for? 
My hope Is that I will stumble across this MacGuffin in my search through the many books and series of the fantasy world.
My desire is that this hoped for saga would be either dark, grimdark or black fantasy. 
I have read Glenn Cooks The Black Company, Erickson's Malazan series, R. Scott Bakker, Moorcock's Elric books, Mark Lawrence and Joe Abercrombie and George R. R. Martin as well as Jemisin. 
These writers have had a profound impact on how and what I read.

423,Fantasy,Riordan Retrospective: The Red Pyramid,"I shared my retrospective of Percy Jackson and the Olympians here, and everyone really liked it.  Just a reminder, it’s less of a formal review and more of a casual look back.  Now, we move on to Riordan second series: The Kane Chronicles.  We begin with a look back at book one of The Kane Chronicles, [The Red Pyramid ](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Pyramid-Kane-Chronicles-Book/dp/1423113381/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=) 

Carter and Sadie Kane are brother and sister, but have hardly ever seen each other.  Carter travels with their dad around the world on archaeological digs, while Sadie lives in London with their maternal grandparents.  Carter and Mr. Kane are visiting Sadie for Christmas vacation, and the trio go on a trip to the British Museum...and Mr. Kane is imprisoned in a sarcophagus of golden light, after blowing up the Rosetta Stone.  

Before long, the siblings discover a number of shocking revelations: the Egyptian gods are both real and active in the modern world, their parents are members of an ancient society of Egyptian magicians called The House of Life, and their dad is being held hostage by the god Set.  Oh, and they've only got five days to make sure Set doesn't take over the world.  Carter and Sadie are in for a whirlwind adventure of gods, monsters and magic.  

I've been a fan of Egyptian Mythology for a long time.  In fact, I was a fan of Egyptian Mythology even before I got into Classical Mythology.  So, you can imagine that I was really excited back when The Kane Chronicles was first announced.  Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed that Riordan mostly shied away from the animal-headedness of many of the Egyptian gods; that was one of the things always made them so cool to me.  Still, I'm overall reasonably happy with how he portrayed the gods.

Well, if I'm being honest, it's a bit more complicated than that.  Let me state up front, I don't thing Riordan necessarily did a bad job with the gods.  As per usual, his knowledge of the myths is second to none.  It's just...well, I've written stories of my own that involve Egyptian gods, so they're kind of like old friends to me.  As such, sometimes it feels weird how Riordan interprets the gods in the modern world.  For example, Thoth is an absent-minded professor.  Nothing bad there in and of itself, just not how I would have written him.  Thought, admittedly, Riordan's Thoth has started to grow on me over the years.  Like I said, nothing inherently bad, just my own bit of weirdness and biases. 

A common criticism the series gets is that the characters are a bit too similar to Percy Jackson characters.  I suppose that's true to an extent.  Carter and Annabeth do have somewhat similarly brainy personalities, but they have enough differences to keep things interesting.  People always say that Sadie is similar to Percy, but I just don't see it.  She just comes across as a bit too bitchy to really be remotely similar to Percy.  Speaking of Sadie, at times it felt like Riordan was trying to make her edgy and rebellious, but had to keep things family friendly, and couldn't go as far as he wanted to. 

I suppose that's why she says ""God!"" so much.  And yeah, God singular.  One of the things I always liked about Percy Jackson was how Riordan adapted to swearing and exclamation to the polytheistic setting, so I was rather disappointed that The Kane Chronicles didn't follow suit, at least for the first two books.  Sadie does also say bloody a lot, but that might have been Riordan slipping up.  For those who don't get it, in British English, using bloody as an exclamation is considered minor swearing, akin to saying shit or damn.  Then again, we all remember that scene in The Titan's Curse at the dam snack bar, so who knows. 

I do think that The Kane Chronicles differs from Percy Jackson in scope and feel.  Percy Jackson takes place almost exclusively in America, baring a few bits in the Bermuda Triangle.  The Kane Chronicles, by contrast, has much more of a globe trekking feel to it.  Granted, much of The Red Pyramid still primarily takes place in America, but we also get scenes set in Britain, France and Egypt.  It does help that, thanks to magic, the characters can teleport across the world at a moment's notice.  Another thing is that you get just as much Ancient Egyptian history as mythology.  Rather than being children of the gods, Carter and Sadie, as well as pretty much everyone else in the House of Life, are descended from the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.  Specifically, they're descended from Narmer on their dad's side, and Ramses the Great on their mom's side.  Fun fact, the House of Life was an actual institution that existed during Ancient Egypt. 

The Egyptian gods have a different feel to them than the Greek gods of Percy Jackson.  They feel, at times, a bit more raw and primeval.  So, let's talk about the concept of hosting.  It took me a while to wrap my head around how works, but I think I've finally figured out an explanation.  An Egyptian god manifesting in the human world without being hosted by something would be like a human stepping onto the Moon without a spacesuit.  The gods need things to help anchor them to the mortal world.  It doesn't have to be humans, it can be anything from a building to a car.  In the latter case, it doubles as a rather literal example of deus ex machina.  They also tend to prefer humans who have Blood of the Pharaohs.   

Now let's get a bit more serious and talk about race, specifically, Carter and Sadie's race.  Their father is black American and their mother is white British.  Carter is looks more black, while Sadie looks more white, to the point that people often don't realize that they're siblings.  This isn't as crazy as it sounds; there's actually quite a few cases of mixed race siblings where each sibling tends to favor one parent's race over the other.  This actually doesn't come up all that much, and never gets preachy.  

This ties into another point: what race were the Ancient Egyptians?  Egypt sits at the crossroads of three continents, so you do get a good mix of peoples.  Overall, though, not all that different from the modern-day Egyptians; meaning similar to the Arabs and other Middle Eastern peoples.  Genetic analysis of mummies has pretty much confirmed this theory.  In fairness, Egypt has several black dynasties during the reign of the Nubians, and we have the very Egyptian Zia Rashid as Carter's eventual love interest as prominent character to provide some balance on the racial front.  Unlike a certain other series, it never dips into ""We Wuz Kangz"" territory, but I'm getting a head of myself.  We'll get to Magnus Chase in our due time.

When I first read this series, I was sure that Iskander, the Chief Lecter of the House of Life, was going to turn out to be Alexander the Great.  Iskander is the Arabic form of the name Alexander, and it is mentioned that he's been around since the Ptolemaic Dynasty.  Sadly, it turns out that I was wrong, and all of the above were red herrings.  Then again, Alexander the Great claimed to be a son of Zeus, so that would have opened a whole new can of worms.  Also, the Chief Lecter is the second in command, and the one who runs the House of Life when the pharaoh isn't around. 

In other events, I'm quite happy with how Set was portrayed.  It's set-up (hahaha, I said set!) to make it look like yet another poorly researched story where Set is portrayed as the Ancient Egyptian Satan, which isn't even close to being true.  Then the story subverts it all by revealing that Set is being manipulated by the true villain of the series: Apophis.  Set has always had a bit of a bad reputation even since ancient times.  You can blame it on the time the Hyksos people invaded Egypt.  Set was their favorite god, so the Egyptians began to associate Set with foreign invaders.  Over time, he got increasingly conflated with Apophis; which is ironic, because Set helped Ra battle Apophis every night.  

I liked how the series was able to reconcile mythology and science.  As Bast explains it, two things can be true in different ways.  Chairs exist, but so does the idea of chairs.  The sun can exist as a physical star, but Ra and his solar barge can exist as the embodiment of humanity's hopes and dreams about the sun.  Also, like The Demigod Files before it, The Red Pyramid confirms that Rick Riordan exists as a character in the Riordanverse.  The Kane Chronicles are explained to be based on a series of audio recording given to Riordan from the Kane siblings.  It also turns out that not every famous person was a demigod.  Some, like Elvis, were members of the House of Life.   

On the flip side, I thought that Riordan could have handled the religious implications better.  For example, Uncle Amos is very adamant that the House of Life doesn't worship the gods...except that what he describes is pretty much worship in all but name.  This is particularly odd, as there's a scene in Battle of the Labyrinth where Percy prays to Apollo and Artemis for good luck, and he's prayed to Poseidon plenty of times.  Even more bafflingly, it's confirmed that Moses existed in the Riordanverse, and was apparently the only magician who ever bet the House of Life in a magic contest.  

Now, there's a couple reasons for why this might be.  One, Riordan himself is a Christian of some stripe; my guess is Episcopalian based on how he used to work for an Episcopalian summer camp.  On the other hand, he did eventually more comfortable incorporating aspects of pagan religion into his books as time went on, so maybe that wasn't it.  More likely, he was fearing backlash from the Religious Right, and other such groups.  Remember, The Red Pyramid was published back when the whole ""Harry Potter Leads Kids to Satanism"" hubbub was still fresh in everyone's memory.  As such, Riordan might have wanted to avoid similar controversy. 

Despite The Kane Chronicles taking place in the same universe as Percy Jackson, we don't really get much in the way of crossovers.  The closest is when Uncle Amos looks to the Empire State Building and remarks that Manhattan has other gods, and other problems.  Well, we don't get much crossover in the main series.  But don’t worry, we’ll get to Demigods &amp; Magicians.  

Speaking of Audible.com, let's take a moment to talk about the audiobook.  It features two narrators; Kevin R. Free narrates Carter's chapters, while Katherine Kellgren narrates Sadie's chapters.  This was my first encounter with Kevin R. Free, and he certainly does a good job.  So imagine my surprise when I encountered him again as the voice of Kevin from Welcome to Night Vale.  It was kind of surreal, since first and foremost, he'll always be Carter Kane to me.  

Now we have to get a little bit sad.  Earlier this year, Katherine Kellgren lost her long battle with cancer and passed away.  She narrated numerous audiobooks over the years, and was a much beloved narrator, but to me she'll always be Sadie Kane.  Was her narrator not always perfect, and sometimes a bit annoying?  Perhaps, but she always gave it her best shot, and whoever replaces her will have some awfully big shoes to fill.  

Let’s analyze the[older and better cover](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jz6baZOfLNc/Wq6oHKg2flI/AAAAAAAAA6E/o6W9f1xQ_6sNi39uh2o46frmZt3iwoAXACLcBGAs/s1600/9780545398268_mres.jpg)

We see Carter and Sadie standing in front of Brooklyn House, seat of the 21st Nome, while magical hieroglyphs float around them.  Nomes were administrative divisions used in Ancient Egypt, and are still used by the House of Life to divide their territory across the world.  There are 360 in total, with the First Nome, the House of Life's headquarters, being based in Egypt.  

I'm not a big fan of the [new cover](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1gnMsXyv6ho/Wq6or6U_RDI/AAAAAAAAA6M/VgP6Uc7o5SMTeGKK-TZt3IhirEEpZkONgCLcBGAs/s1600/Red%2BPyrmaid%2BNu%2BCover.jpg).  Aesthetically, it just feel like a big step backwards.  Even the new logo looks like a step backwards.  We see Carter and Sadie standing behind the Brooklyn Bridge, with the Red Pyramid looming in the background.  Also, there's a statue of either Amun or Khnum, despit neither of them appearing in The Red Pyramid.  What else can I say?  The new cover sucks.

*Processing img vlxq593b2om61...*

Hey there!

My name is RavensDagger, and I’m an indie web-serial author who happens to like making maps.

I’m still far from good, but I thought I’d share some of the maps that I include in my books and web-serials. They’re a lot of fun to make, and I thought that a few of you might appreciate them!

The map above is the main world-map for Cinnamon Bun, a story freely available on Royal Road, and less-freely available in print on Amazon and in audio on audible. (No maps for the audio versions, which is lame!)

&amp;#x200B;

[Map following the main character's voyage in the first arcs of Volume One](https://preview.redd.it/yvgw9rmj2om61.jpg?width=3300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c59836d79803f34f477474c19bb7a709b3a8ca77)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rfw4ym8n2om61.jpg?width=1250&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0cc16f49b0a79d624f4014ffada6577616c138b

&amp;#x200B;

[A city map, from Volume Three of Cinnamon Bun](https://preview.redd.it/q4igatap2om61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196f89d1c19f43dddfa1d1530cee2fcdce02e837)

The next two are maps for a story called Dead Tired. It's a story that I wrote live, writing and releasing one chapter a day for an entire month. Every chapter was written in front of an audience and then posted for free on Royal Road. The first volume is being edited now and might make it to audio one of these days.

&amp;#x200B;

[World Map, or at least a map of the continent where the story takes place!](https://preview.redd.it/pxr1fuby2om61.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f94060e33a16812312f5ccac08023a0a342e7a8)

&amp;#x200B;

[A zoomed-in map of the locations in the second volume, including cities and important locations!](https://preview.redd.it/9m7hwzp13om61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c2c117af0305887980a83caa41a42fa026efdc3)

This next one is a map for The Agartha Loop, an on-going serial where all the lost cities of the world are real, but are in another world. The premise is that portals are opening up between Earth and these locations, and all the mythological monsters from myth and legend are slipping back to Earth. It's a weird story. The world-building for it was fun though! 

&amp;#x200B;

[Agartha and the links to Earth](https://preview.redd.it/w1f3qwyw4om61.png?width=1581&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286065cded1f138a218558c08a80596c47424ff7)

And that's it! I have plenty more, but the quality of some are dubious at best. Hope you enjoyed! 

I mostly use Wonderdraft for my maps, with some added AoA assets from their commercial pack (on CartographyAssets.com ). The cities are made in Watabou, then traced in Krita and modified in GIMP. There're are some custom-drawn assets here and there too, but my drawing skills are questionable at best!

433,Fantasy,My First Completed Bingo Card with Mini Reviews,"Hi everyone! This was my first year participating in the Bingo and it was a lot of fun! I am not very good with reviews and English isn't my native language (sorry in advance for the mistakes!) so I will keep it short and simple.

**First Row:**

* **Novel Translated from its Original Language** \- **Wachen! Wachen!** by *Terry Pratchett* (*Guards! Guards!)* My only re-read in the challenge, I read this book in German (not my native language) while I was preparing for my language exam. It is hard to say things about the Discworld novels that haven't been said a thousand times before. This book is funny, exciting and smart, and I just kept exploring new things that I hadn't noticed in my previous reads. 
* **Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold**  (**Hard mode**:  The entire book takes place in this setting)  
\- **A Cavern of Black Ice** by *J.V.Jones* This was probably my worst reading experience during the challenge. Reading this book felt like a chore: the story goes forward very slowly and seemed like the writer just assumed that the reader already knows some characters or places. After reading 20 pages of this book I had to make sure that I didn't accidentally started reading a book from the middle of a series. The most annoying for me was that the book constantly bombarded me with unnecessary trivia about surviving in the winter or about that one clan that lives in this specific valley and has no role in the whole book whatsoever (but did you know that they shave their left eyebrow, braid their hair with horse dung, use aluminum weapons, their house is called *Thisanthathal*l and their words are...). . I liked some elements though, like magic users having to pay a great price to use their magic, but still I won't read the next book in the series.
* **Optimistic SFF** (**Hard mode**: Not Becky Chambers)- **Swordheart** by *T Kingfisher* One of my favorites on this list. The characters are well written and even those that aren't very likeable have believable goals and motivations. I am not very big for romance in fantasy, but this was surprisingly good and around the middle of the book I found myself actually emotionally invested for the two main characters and their relationship. It was great to finally read a fantasy book where the conflict isn't saving the whole world and the protagonists aren't kids/young adult Marry Sue's, who just magically fell in love with each for no good reason. 2020 was a stressful year and I really needed the good feelings that I received from this book.
* **Novel Featuring Necromancy** \- **Gideon The Ninth** by *Tamsyn Muir* This book received a lot of hype in r/fantasy, but for some reason I don't get it. For me it wasn't very special, neither story- nor character-wise. It was fun, but it didn't get me interested enough to continue reading the series.
* **Ace / Aro Spec Fic** (**Hard mode**: Ace / Aro protagonist)- **Sufficiently Advanced Magic** by *Andrew Rowe* MEHH. I was excited for this book. At first it seemed like it will check I my boxes: I like well-detailed magic systems, progression, school settings, fantasy books about magical towers and even LitRPGs. But this was just MEHH. I found the story and the setting uninteresting and couldn't really care for the protagonist nor for any of the other characters. Also, maybe this is only true for the particular edition I've read, but the books isn't very well written: even I as non-native speaker could find spelling errors and missing words in the text. 

**Second Row :**

* **Novel Featuring a Ghost** (**Hard mode**:  At least one main protagonist is a ghost) - **Summerland** by *Hannu Rajaniemi.* The premise seemed interesting at first (spies working in the Otherworld, political conflicts generated and manipulated by ghosts), and this book had some good concepts as well (e.g. life energy as currency for ghost) but overall this book didn't make a big impression on me. 
* **Novel Featuring Exploration** (**Hard mode**:  The exploration is the central plot )- **The Tropic Of Serpents** by *Marie Brennan* The second book in the  The Memoirs of Lady Trent Series and I enjoyed it even more than the first one. I like how the world of the book is very similar to ours and still very different. The human conflicts, politics and colonialism is still the same even when dragons roam in the world. 
* **Climate Fiction** \- **The Fifth Season** by *N.K. Jemisin* Geomancy doesn't get enough love and attention in fantasy, but this book finally does it some justice. I really liked the setting, the world itself and how people reacted to the constant change of the hostile world. The characters were great, I liked how the most powerful people in this book were also the most vulnerable. Although the cliffhanger at the end was predictable from about the middle of the book, it still made me want to read the whole series.
* **Novel with a Colour in the Title** \- **The Grey Bastards** by *Jonathan French* There aren't many books written from the perspective of orcs and even fewer about half-orcs. This book had so many interesting things in it: halfling religion, prophecies, tribal politics, a mage doing magic with a  hookah, a slime necromancer, elven plague experiments...  I really enjoyed it!
* **Any** [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) **Book Club Book of the Month OR** [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) **Read-along Book** \-**The Lies of Locke Lamora** by *Scott Lynch* Another book often recommended on this sub. The first paragraph has already pulled me in and didn't let me go for 3 books. The world felt alive, the magic somewhat unique and the heists thrilling. Great humor and great characters.

**Third Row:**

* **Self-Published SFF Novel** \- **The Cybernetic Tea Shop** by *Meredith Katz* Short and sweet book with an interesting point of view, a compelling story and a positive ending. Reading it felt like a good warm cup of tea. 
* **Novel with Chapter Epigraphs** (**Hard mode**: Original to the novel)- **Senlin Ascends** by *Josiah Bancroft*. I am a sucker for magical towers and this book was among my favorites this year. It had such an unique feel to it, I really want to see where the story continues. The character progression of the protagonist is among the best I have ever read.
* **Novel Published in 2020** \- **The House in the Cerulean Sea** by *T. J. Klune* I was actually surprised how good this book made me feel. Again, I found myself rooting for the protagonists and even though I can't really cry, I was close to it in the end of this book.
* **Novel Set in a School or University** (**Hard mode**:  Not Harry Potter or the Magicians) - **Super Powereds** by *Drew Hayes* This book starts a little bit rough, like when web series authors don't really know yet where the story will go and what the personality of the characters will be like. But it has a good premise and everything else also gets better as the story moves forward.. Even though the end of the series is a bit cheesy, it was still a good read.
* **Book About Books** \- **The Ten Thousand Doors of January** by *Alix E. Harrow* This was a really refreshing and enjoyable book. ""Doors between worlds"" isn't a very new concept, still this book's execution of it was great.  The bad part is, that now I really want to travel and explore the world...

**Fourth Row:**

* **A Book that Made You Laugh** (**Hard mode**: No Pratchett) - **Nevernight** by *Jay Kristoff* I don't really know if I consider this a good book. It has some bad parts (I've read better smut) and some concepts that I find dumb, but it also has some merits, like the occasional dry humor that I actually enjoyed.
* **Five SFF Short Stories** (**Hard mode**:  Read an entire SFF anthology or collection)- **Azazel** by *Isaac Asimov* The Fundation series was an important part of my teen years, so I had big hopes for Asimov's Azazel stories. I liked them, although after some time it became a little bit repetitive: Azazel is like that subreddit, ""The Monkey's Paw"". After reading a few stories, you know how the rest will go: somebody wishes something, they receive it, but there is a twist that actually just makes things worse.
* **Big Dumb Object** \- **Diamond Dogs, Turqoise Days** by *Alastair Reynold* Magic towers, again. Although I didn't read Reynold's other works, these two novellas were really enjoyable in themselves. I especially liked Diamond Dog's take on trans-humanism.
* **Feminist Novel** \- **Circe** by *Madeline Miller* I love Greek mythology, who doesn't? This book features a protagonist who is relatable even though she is the immortal daughter of a river and the Sun and introduces some well known Greek heroes from a different, more human angle. 
* **Novel by a Canadian Author** \-**Bloody Rose** by *Nicholas Eames* The second book in The Band series. I found this book enjoyable,but a bit worse than the first book. The ""This is *Soandso*, frontman/frontwoman of the Band *Funny Reference To Actual Rock Bands""* jokes get old after a while.

**Fifth Row:**

* **Novel with a Number in the Title** \- **The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August** by *Catherine Webb* A thrilling battle of ""4d chess"" between an actually smart, quasi-immortal protagonist and an at least as smart, also immortal antagonist, spanning through several generations.
* **Romantic Fantasy / Paranormal Romance** \-**Good Intentions** by *Elliott Kay* I have read worse smut. This wasn't a bad read, I really liked how this books mocks vampires, but there were some elements that I found weird or uncomfortable, like the harem-y parts. 
* **Novel with a Magical Pet** (**Hard mode**: Magical pet also can speak) - **Blackflame** by *Will Wight* Some people might disagree with me if Orthos is actually a pet, but I think it counts. The first book of the Cradle series tricked me into reading progression fantasy that I'd thought I wouldn't enjoy. Boy, I was wrong. After finishing the first book in about a day, I read the rest of the series in short succession. For this reason, it is hard for me to form an opinion about Blackflame alone. The series is a great story about an underdog becoming powerful by some luck and lot of trickery and hard work. The only thing that bothered me through: doesn't matter on which level Lindon is, everyone else around him seem to be on a higher level. When he progresses, these people (who are now supposed to be on his level) just seem to disappear and replaced by others who are once again stronger than him. 
* **Format: Graphic Novel (at least 1 vol.) OR Audiobook / Audio drama** (**Hard mode**:  has to be over 25 hours long)- **Mother of Learning** by *nobody 103* I really enjoyed this book, the setting, the character progression and the very detailed magic system. I listened Jack Voraces's reading until about Chapter 87 (after that he stopped reading it because of legal reasons) and I finisher the book by listening to John Gilmore's reading. Both narrators were great but I got used some of the weird accents Voraces did, so I missed them in the Gilmore narrations. (For the fans: Zach's and Kirrielle's voices grew on me)
* **Novel Featuring Politics** \- **The Goblin Emperor** by *Katherina Addison* Another big favorite on this sub. I wouldn't have minded if the goblins are little more ""goblin-like"" in this book, but other than that I can say nothing against this book. Great read about the politics and machinations of a court with a relatable protagonist.

I really enjoyed this year's Bingo Challenge and I am looking forward for the next year's card. At the beginning I said I will keep this post short, looks like I didn't succeed :D"

436,Fantasy,Any Well Written Power Fantasy/OP Protagonist Books?,"So I'm a pretty large-scale hater of power fantasy ""trash"" because honestly so many times when I read it, it feels like it bleeds insecurity. The ineptness of the world vs the OP protagonists feels like way too much of a gap for me to not visibly cringe and sigh in disbelief. IMHO it feels like it's written as a metaphor for how the author feels underappreciated and misunderstood more than half the time BUT I REFUSE to believe there's not well-written power fantasy out there.

So what I'm looking for is something power fantasy but just, IDK, make it feel at least semi-believable. Rather than a world that's inept and a protagonist who just is semi-decent and has more than 1 brain cells; I'm looking for a world that just ya know isn't functioning the best it could be and the protagonist is able to change it and he/she is OP in some way. Maybe the protagonist is cheating/got lucky but as long as it flows well enough I can deal with it.

I'm not even necessarily looking for a GOOD power fantasy story even a 6/10-7/10 is fine just something that doesn't make me nauseous."
437,Fantasy,Para's Proper Reviews: A Stranger in Olondria by Sofia Samatar,"&gt; *It is dangerous to build. Once you have built something – something that takes all your passion and will – it becomes more precious to you than your own happiness. You don’t realize that, while you are building it. That you are creating a martyrdom – something, which, later, will make you suffer.*
  
And with this, I am done with the 2020 Bingo!

*The Winged Histories* ([which I also reviewed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/c68h4m/paras_proper_reviews_the_winged_histories_by/)) is one of my all-time favourites, so I was incredibly curious how would the first book in the series (really, the two can be read in any order) compare. I’m all for literary fantasy with lovely prose, so that I would like it to at least some extent was pretty much a given, but I still *far* prefer its sequel.

Structurally, this is much more of a traditional novel than *The Winged Histories*. It follows one character, Jevick, as he travels from his island country to Olondria and becomes haunted by the ghost of a girl along the way who demands to write her a book. His efforts to get himself rid of the ghosts compared with some of the Olondrians viewing the ghosts as angels and therefore sacred gets him into quite a lot of trouble.

Jevick is never really a central protagonist, a driver of events in the traditional sense. He is much more the type who gets caught in the current of something much larger than himself. But that doesn’t mean he’s passive and his motivation is clear: initially to travel to Olondria, the contry he heard so much about, then the need to get rid of the ghost/angel haunting him overpowers all else. And even as a catalyst, he does have impact on Olondrian history.

Another large theme of the book are books themselves, and the power they have. Jevick’s love of reading, his ghost wanting a book written about her, the books forbidden and burned by Olondria’s new religion, various mentions of Olondrian classical literature, it’s very much a book about books.

Unfortunately, its biggest strength is also its biggest weakness. It’s so focused on prose that I found it hard to stay engaged. The narrative style made it feel distant and what worked in *The Winged Histories*, which is much more fragmented and experimental in structure, did not quite work here. It felt empty in a strange way, like it was missing something. I’m not sure what –  the main components are all there. But I struggled.

Still, if you’re looking for literary fantasy, it might be worth a read.

438,Fantasy,Corrupt Abyss Magic,"Corrupt Abyssal magic is also known as forbidden magic that can use the logistics of shadow, spatial, and smoke magic. A user is able to bend space as they please because abyssal is a cross-dimensional type of magic but originated in the demon dimension. The user can freely move from point A to B through their ‘abyssal’ dimension, the user can also send their enemies to their never-ending abyssal dimension where logic struggles to exist. The only way a victim can defeat an abyssal magic-user is if that victim is an anti-magic or demonic magic user but if the abyssal magic-user is skilled enough it can still win over the demonic magic user but will always fail to the anti-magic user. One of the abyssal magic user’s greatest abilities is it can turn the user into abyssal smoke, abyssal smoke is when the user can turn themselves into dark smoke making any object go right through them but some other magic users can use their magic to entrap the smoke, and anti-magic users can still hit their opponent even if they’re in their smoke form because anti-magic will always win against magic"

440,Fantasy,Breach of Peace by Daniel Greene | Spoiler-Free Review,"Breach of Peace is Daniel Greene's debut novella in what is planned to be a trilogy of novellas that are leading up to his full novel series. I worked with Daniel doing the cover layout for Breach of Peace (the beautiful cover art is by Felix Ortiz) and consider him a friend, but with that being said I will be keeping this review as un-biased as possible. 

Here's my video review: [https://youtu.be/XRledNAT94Y](https://youtu.be/XRledNAT94Y)

&amp;#x200B;

 I’m always hesitant to go into a book written by a youtuber, because often their audience hypes up their work way too much. And lets be honest, lots of times YouTuber books are not that great. I’m happy to say, Breach of Peace is a solid debut novella! There’s a few little things that I’ll get into, but my overall experience was enjoyable and I’m looking forward to read more that Daniel writes.  


**Genre:**  
 This novella’s been ranking on amazon in several genre’s including dark fantasy, grim dark, military fantasy, flintlock fantasy and even horror. I would probably say it’s like a fantasy detective story with some horror elements.  
 

**Story:**  
The story opens with a crime scene described in gruesome detail. An imperial family is found butchered in their home, and it’s up to three inspectors to get to the bottom of it. This includes Inspector Khlid as well as her husband Samuel, and a man named Chapman who’s like the star of the Seventh Precinct. Evidence points to a rebel group trying to stab fear into the empire, and a larger conspiracy begins to come to light, as inspector Khlid struggles to trust even the officers around her. 

This introduction definitely sets the dark tone you can expect from this novella, and the descriptions and atmosphere were especially strong here.  


**Characters:**  
 The the dialogue and dynamic between these three characters especially I found to be one of the major strong points to this story. It was refreshing to read the relationship between Khlid and Samuel because they already have this chemistry between them, idk why it was kind of remind me of the couple in To Sleep In a Sea of Stars. However, I just wish we got to see more of Samuel as I feel like he's the weaker character of the three. Chapman is my favorite, he's kind of an ass sometimes though you can tell his brain is just wired differently and he isn't always trying to be an ass. This is where I see a bit of an Arthur Conan Doyle inspiration, and being a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, I loved it. Chapman feels like Daniel's nod to Sherlock without ripping off that character at all. Chapman and Khlid especially I felt were very distinct. I felt like I cared for both of these characters in this short novella.   


**Worldbuilding:**  
 For some reason I automatically thought of this world as being sort of Steampunk, I was thinking of something similar to like the Dishonored games. But its not really steampunk at all, I messaged Daniel about it... and he said no.. it's not steampunk. Its set in an industrial era world that's run by an Orwellian society, one that’s led by someone calling themself god and there’s basically no free will. The police force work for god and can get away with whatever because they’re above everyone else. And we’re following these people. These Police officers receiving a case from the almighty, feels almost like a holy experience to them, like they’re being drawn closer to The Almighty by carrying out its will through the system it has created.   
 

So we’re following protagonists who are kind of indoctrinated into this religious cult that reigns over the government and they think they’re actions are justified. I've seen a small amount of controversy about this, with some people trying to frame Daniel for believing in that stuff. Which is ridiculous, I remember him previously stating that one of his biggest fears with this book is people projecting the belief of his characters on to him, when he’s decided to write from a perspective that he does not believe in. He recently made a video talking about authorial intent and how authors don’t always believe what they write. Writing about something doesn't automatically mean you endorse it. As much as I love the first law by Joe abercrombie, I don’t love the things that his characters do, and I’m sure he’s not promoting torture. I feel like it’s pretty clear after reading the Breach of Peace that Daniel is setting up a social critique of power given to the police as well as religious extremists. And I think there is a conspiracy within this book that’s building up and will be revealed further on in the story. 

With that being said some of this is a touchy subject for a lot of people, so in that case this novella just might not be for you. Anyway back to the worldbuilding,

In such a small format, this is a 140 page novella, he handles the worldbuilding very well and establishing the dynamics of this society, and I feel like we get all this info as it flows with the story. It didn’t feel like we were getting large info dumps of information. I do feel like we are lacking description in some areas. Besides the extremely solid description of the intro, I can’t really picture the other environments in this story, I feel like the cover art is letting my imagination fill that in, but I would have liked to have seen some more work done to building description and atmosphere for this world, which of course then also connects to the tone and mood of the story.  


 **Writing:**

Now this leads me to talk about the writing. Besides the odd clunky line here and there, I've read a lot by self-published authors AND traditionally published authors that are not as good as this, I was actually surprised at how well it reads especially for a debut novel. Though I can tell Daniel is still finding his voice, and I look forward to seeing his writing style improve with each novella.

I see people comparing this to Brandon Sanderson Elantris, which I really don’t see a connection there. I think maybe Mistborn with the straightforward writing style and the lord ruler sort of oppression going on. I would say Breach of Peace feels more inspired from Stephen King, Arthur Conan Doyle and maybe even a bit of HP Lovecraft, and I think it’s a really great mix.   
His prose is pretty straightforward it's nothing too elegant but I feel like it's solid and it goes with the gritty dark story he’s trying to tell, but like I said I would have liked a little more description. I love detective stories and mystery, and I especially love when those elements are brought over into fantasy. There’s a lot of intrigue that I feel like carries its way through the entire book and he also  balances important character moments with action scenes very well. The overall structure of the novella is great. I read this novella twice, and the first time I read it all in one sitting because the pacing really made me want to continue on and learn more. There was a slight drop in pacing around chapter 3 or 4 but it wasn’t enough to lose my interest. His descriptions of crime scenes and the horror aspects of this book where the strongest parts along with his character dialogue. And even with the darkness of this story there’s even a little bit of subtle comedy through dialogue that I feel blends in seamlessly.

Usually I like my novellas to have some sort of resolution and feel contained, but Breach of Peace sort of feels like an episode or part one. I feel like its hard to make a complete judgment on just a teaser of a story, and it does kind of feel like a teaser to what we can expect later on. It sounds like Daniel wants to get the next 2 novella’s out fairly quick, so I think that is a good move. And I think eventually it would be nice to see a bind-up of all three of these novellas.   


 **Conclusion:**

Overall I gotta say, I’m impressed with Daniel’s debut. I think he’s only going to grow as a writer from here and I can’t wait to see some of the technical aspects of his writing improve and to see where this story is going (especially once the full series begins). The prose is pretty basic but it does the job well and his characters are interesting and the dialogue is great for the most part. It's a little difficult to picture the world at times since there needs to be a little more description, and I think it could have benefitted from being a longer novella rather than a short teaser. I would recommend Breach of Peace to anyone who likes a dark mystery stories and detective fantasy. Just know that you are going to get all the answers here. If you are very sensitive to dark themes and brutal crime descriptions then you probably don’t want to read this one."

**FIRST ROW ACROSS**

**Novel Translated from its Original Language  - The Days of the Deer by Liliana Bodoc**

This work by Argentinian fantasy author Bodoc pits the disparate people of the Fertile Lands against a the threat of an evil mystical being from across the sea and his invading force. This story of the struggle of indigenous people against foreign invaders is infused with primal forces of magic, wizards and extraordinary creatures. It has a strong mythical feeling to it, and I was not surprised to learn that Ursula Le Guin was a big fan of Bodoc's because I think the closest thing I can compare this to in writing style and tone is *The Wizard of Earthsea.* While some reviewers complained about the distant tone and found the book boring, I really enjoyed it- 4/5 stars.

**Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold** \- **The Tiger Came Down the Mountain by Nghi Vo**

The cleric Chih is back in this novella, sequel to *The Empress of Salt and Fortune*, and this time they're making their way through icy passes on the back of a mammoth while stalked by hungry tigers. Chih tells a story about tigers to save their life and the lives of their companions, and what follows is a wonderful and clever work about the power of stories and how our backgrounds shape their telling. Beautifully-written and brilliant just like the first one - 5/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3846561221?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**Optimistic SFF - Radiance by Grace Draven**

Royals from different species and bound together in an arranged marriage, Brishen and Idilko are delighted to discover that they are quick friends. Their friendship blossoms into love over the course of this story. There's virtually no drama or conflict in this story whatsoever, and it's mostly just about two good and kind people liking each other more and more and learning about each other's cultures. A lot of people love the romance between the two of them and it's a nice change of pace from senseless drama and conflict, but it was missing something for me and the utter lack of stakes in the story left me unsatisfied. 3/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2651512595?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1)).

**Novel Featuring Necromancy - The Unspoken Name by A.K. Larkwood**

The orc Csorwe abandons her fate as sacrifice to her god and is taken in by an elven mage determined to return himself to power. She trains to become his agent, and her work for him takes her to a number of truly fascinating and imaginative places. I loved her disastrous and miserably mean fellow agent Tal, as well as the wonderful humor and amazing settings. Some aspects of the plot felt quite messy to me, however, and I didn't totally buy some of the character transformations and emotional beats. Still a great deal of fun and I'm looking forward to the next book - 3/5 stars. (Longer review [here.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3028265094?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1))

**Ace/Aro Spec Fic - The Once and Future Witches by Alix E. Harrow**

This book follows three sisters at the end of the 19th century in an alternate United States as they fight to restore the lost art of women's magic and their fraught relationships with each other. I basically cried throughout the whole thing because I'm a sap for books about women *coming together* and *deciding they've had enough* and *finding strength in their relationships with each other.* I didn't feel very connected to any of the characters, though, and their character arcs and defining traits and representation felt a little heavy-handed to me. I have a few other quibbles but this gets a 4/5 stars from me. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3305774262?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**SECOND ROW ACROSS**

**Novel Featuring a Ghost - The Ghost Bride by Yangsze Choo**

A Chinese girl living in colonial Malaya, Li Lan, receives an unexpected offer to become a rich man's ghost bride after his death. When she declines it sets off a chain reaction of events that forces her to find her way out of the Underworld. I loved the actual depictions of ghosts and strange magic in the Underworld and overall this was a very enjoyable reading experience, but I was annoyed by how ineffective Li Lan was, how often she had to be rescued and how smarmy I found her love interest to be. 3/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1729179093?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**Novel Featuring Exploration - Piranesi by Susanna Clarke**

Piranesi lovingly documents the endless Halls and Tides of the beneficent House, but strange happenings in the House make him start to question his past and the nature of his relationship with the only living person he knows. This is a beautiful, beautiful book that's quite unlike anything I've read before. Part of what makes it so magical is that Piranesi is such a delightful and good-hearted character; the atmosphere is amazing and the ending is perfectly bittersweet. 5/5 stars. (Longer review [here.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3035508077?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1))

**Climate Fiction - The Word for World is Forest by Ursula Le Guin**

This book follows the colonization of the lush planet Athshe by rapacious Terrans, the oppression of the peaceful indigenous race and what happens when one brutal colonial officer's actions instigate a rebellion in people who previously had no conception of violence or war. It's a horrible and incisive look at the greed, destruction and dehumanization that lie at the heart of colonialism, and the way that the project of colonization leaves both the colonizer and the colonized changed forever. 4/5 stars. (Longer review [here.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2193853532?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1))

**Novel with a Color in the Title - Black Sun by Rebecca Roanhorse**

This book set in a secondary world inspired by pre-Columbian Americas, counts down the days until the winter solstice, which happens at the same time as a solar eclipse. A blinded and scarred man must make his way to the city of Tova to fulfil his destiny on the eclipse. A huge strength of this book is the world-building and its celebration of indigenous cultures, while I also liked the perspective characters of Serapio and Xiala. I didn't think the other two perspective characters worked very well and other readers pointed out to me how incomplete the story felt without its sequel. Still incredibly fun to read - 4/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3258966561?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**Any** [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) **Book Club Book of the Month OR** [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) **Read-along Book**  **- The Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster Bujold**

Cazaril returns from war and enslavement a broken man, and when he becomes tutor to the sister of the boy next in line to rule he is drawn into a world of danger and intrigue that soon sees him cursed horribly and desperate to unravel the will of the gods. I absolutely adore Cazaril as a main character and nearly everything about this book is thoughtful and mature, from the other characters' characterization to the meditations on fate and religion. My only complaint is that I didn't care about the romance - 5/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3514540637?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**THIRD ROW ACROSS**

**Self-Published SFF Novel** **-The Sword of Kaigen by M.L. Wang**

This follows the Kaigenese Matusda family as they are forced to question their loyalties and face an invading force. I love Misaki as a main character facing the state of her marriage, her motherhood and her past, and I think her struggle to determine her autonomy and happiness is fantastic. I think the story falters with her husband Takeru's sudden transformation and I have a few quibbles related to writing and pacing. 4/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2680707972?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**Novel with Chapter Epigraphs - A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine**

Ambassador Malit arrives to the heart of Teixcalaan's massive empire determined to preserve her tiny station's autonomy and unravel the death of her predecessor. I thoroughly enjoyed the political intrigue and I think Martine does a great job of depicting the conundrum that some colonized people face in admiring/loving a culture that is bent on destroying their own. I didn't connect with any of the characters, however, largely because I got tired of them all having the same droll, quippy, detached way of constantly bantering with each other with little reaction to what happens in the plot. I was also annoyed by a few of Martine's writing tics and I felt that she could have gone deeper in her exploration of empire and the book's memory technology. 3/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2685154232?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**Novel Published in 2020 - Return of the Thief by Megan Whalen Turner**

Eugenides is now high king of the Little Peninsula and he must rally the Peninsula against the forthcoming invasion of the Medes. This particular story is narrated by a really interesting character in Pheris, a disfigured and disabled boy who is almost universally despised. It's a joy to see all of the characters from this series gathered in the same story and it's definitely a very satisfying conclusion. 4/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2471883991?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**Novel Set in a School or University- A Deadly Education by Naomi Novik**

Prickly loner El is forced to survive in the deadly, monster-filled Scholomance, from which she will hopefully emerge as an adult able to control her dark magic. She is bewildered when the class's hero Orion tries to befriend her, and together they will work to make the Scholomance a little more tolerable. I really enjoyed El's grumpy narrative voice, as well as the descriptions of the school, monsters and magic. There is a massive amount of exposition however, which slows the plot down significantly. 3/5 stars.

**A Book About Books - The Year of the Witching by Alexis Henderson**

Emanuelle struggles with her country Bethel's rigid, puritanical piety and conformity, especially as she is a woman, not white and hated for her mother's sins. When she finds her mother's old diary, she starts to question the world she knows and its rules until she is unable to resist the allure of the forbidding woods and its rumors of witches, unleashing disaster. This is the second feminist book I've read about witching as a conduit for women's power but I liked this one a lot less than *The Once and Future Witches,* largely because of the bland characters and the ways that Henderson regularly undercuts and muddies the book's feminist messages. 2/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3454870071?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**FOURTH ROW ACROSS**

**A Book That Made You Laugh - The Order of the Pure Moon Reflected in Water by Zen Cho**

Guet Imm, a young votary of the aforementioned order, joins up with a ragtag group of bandits in order to protect a sacred object and finds herself entangled in quite a mess. Like the other books I've read by Zen Cho, this is a gentle and wryly funny story with a delightful lady protagonist. I don't know if it truly fulfills its promise of a found family, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. 4/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3035509057?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**Five SFF Short Stories**

1. The Old Nurse’s Story by Elizabeth Gaskell– old women with regrets and vicious secrets, icy moors, organs playing in the night and a haunted little girl. Gaskell's ghost stories have a recurring theme of abusive, violent men and the first one makes his appearance here in the form of the ghosts’ murderer, their proud and cruel father and grandfather. 4/5 stars.
2. The Poor Clare by Elizabeth Gaskell– this story involves a witch’s curse, lost love and a young woman’s ghostly doppleganger that everyone says is soooooooo evil but really just seems to like playing pranks and trying to have sex. I guess by Victorian standards is was pretty evil for an unmarried young woman (or female-presenting ghostly doppleganger) to want that… I used to read basically nothing but Victorian literature but I’ve been away from it for a while and this story’s love interest was a reminder of just how utterly boring, spineless and lifeless female characters can be in Victorian lit. It was pretty unbearable. 4/5
3. The Doom of the Griffiths by Elizabeth Gaskell - here we have a family curse, a deeply and annoyingly self-pitying main character, lots and lots of telling rather than showing and another child killed by a vengeful grandfather. 2/5 stars.
4. Curious If True by Elizabeth Gaskell - this one features classic fairy tale characters hilariously reinterpreted. It was really fun but also had the worst ending of the bunch because it was so incredibly abrupt. 4/5 stars.
5. Women in the Trees by Pat Murphy - this is one of the best short stories I've read in a while, as well as one of the best stories about intimate partner violence I've read. In it a woman is drawn to the woods behind the house she's just moved to with her husband, fleeing there for the company of the trees in her isolation, as well as in panic when she can't tolerate his violence any longer. There are women in the trees and they want to help her. 5/5 stars.

**Big Dumb Object - Silver in the Woods by Emily Tesh**

Tobias, the Wild Man of the Woods, is disrupted in his peaceful life with the arrival of eager young folklorist Henry Silver. Henry has all kinds of questions, and his prodding leads to the awakening of past wrongs. This is a sweet and lush little novella, and my favorite part was the atmosphere of the ancient, mysterious woods. I wish that the romance had had a little more time to grow, as well as some of the plot towards the end. 4/5 stars.

**Feminist Novel - Daughter of the Woods by Juliet Marillier**

Daughter of the Woods follows young Sorcha as she struggles to undo the curse placed on her six brothers, which has transformed them into swans. This is a beautiful novel that is absolutely cram-packed with suffering. I believe that Marillier did an overall great job depicting Sorcha's experience of sexual assault and sexism as well as creating a beautiful central romance, but I do think the assault could have been less graphic in comparison the consensual sex scene, while I wish that Sorcha hadn't been so young while falling in love with an adult man. 4/5 stars.

**Novel by a Canadian Author - Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia**

Set in 1950s Mexico, Mexican Gothic follows a charming socialite named  Noemí  as she embarks on a mission to discover the cause of her cousin's bizarre letters sent from her husband's forbidding and isolated home. I had a lot of fun with this one, as I think the spooky atmosphere is great and I enjoyed the eventual supernatural story that's pieced together. I did feel that the writing was a little awkward in places and wasn't entirely sold on how it handled the amount of sexual violence that was present. 4/5 stars.

FIFTH ROW ACROSS

**Novel with a Number in the Title - Harrow the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir**

After the horrible events at Canaan House in the previous book Harrow is a lector, and seemingly losing her mind. This second book adds a ton of world-building and a clever plot full of revelations, which I really enjoyed. It's still hilarious and oppressive and amazingly well-written. Its format is very inventive but I will say that I still struggled to care about/keep straight a lot of the characters, found the Canaan house sections to be incredibly repetitive and found a few of Harrow's breakthroughs/emotional beats to be slightly unsatisfying. In addition, I wish that the mystery had actually been something that it was possible for the reader to work to solve. 3/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3203701131?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**Romantic Fantasy - In the Vanisher's Palace by Aliette de Bodard**

This Vietnamese-inspired Beauty and the Beast retelling follows Yên, a scholar who is sold to the dragon Vu Côn. She explores the dragon's world and it becomes apparent that the malignant influence of the Vanishers, an oppressor that 9surprise) mysteriously vanished, still remains. I thought the writing was great and loved the magic and the world-building that existed. I didn't particularly care about the central romance though,  partially because the book's messages about moving forwards into a world of greater fairness and consent were undercut by Vu Côn owning Yên and controlling her life for most of their romance. Other than that, I just don't think the romance and story in general had enough time to breathe and develop. 3/5 stars.

**Novel with a Magical Pet - Akata Witch by Nnedi Okorafor**

Twelve year old Sunny is struggling to adapt to her new life in Nigeria when she discovers that she is a Leopard Person, endowed with great magic. The magical world shines here, with so many delightful details (including the aforementioned magical pet in the form of a melodramatic and sensitive artistic wasp). However, I found the constant bickering between Sunny and her friends to be very grating, and they made a few decisions that made very little sense to me. 3/5 stars. (Longer review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2193836482?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1).)

**Graphic Novel (at least one volume) - The Adventure Zone: Petals to the Metal by Clint, Justin, Griffin and Travis McElroy, illustrated by Carey Pietsch**

Adapted from the popular D&amp;D podcast, this third arc follows Tres Horny Boys as they try to recover an powerful artifact in the hands of a criminal and master racer. There's plant seduction, glorious magical familiars and more. Petals to the Metal was my least favorite arc of the TAZ podcast because it was so hard to follow all of the action during the racing, so it was great to see it all play out visually with awesome art by Carey Pietsch. It's as funny and charming as ever and gets right to the heart of why I love D&amp;D. 5/5 stars.

**Novel Featuring Politics - Everfair by Nisi Shawl**

This is a steampunk alternate history that retells the story of the colonization of the Congo by Belgium. What if Fabian socialists bought land in the Congo to create a paradise for themselves and a haven for Congo's slaves? What if they developed steampunk tech to fight against King Leopold's forces? I thin Shawl did an excellent job of depicting the historical realities of life in the Congo and I really appreciate the underlying message that the white idealists could not understand how their colonization of Everfair was still wrong even if they didn't commit Leopold's atrocities. Unfortunately, this book features a massive number of characters and covers a huge span of time, with both in a way that left me unsatisfied. The author often skipped over the most interesting events and characters developed inexplicably as time passed, which was frustrating. 3/5 stars.

442,Fantasy,I love traditional fantasy races and creatures,"Hi guys, 

I often see a lot of negativity around classic Fantasy races/creatures such as Dwarves, Elves, Goblins etc but does anyone else love these?  Especially when they're more fleshed out or changed in more modern works eg. Elder scrolls, The Witcher.

However, I still love the classic thing of Elves being beautiful, Dwarves being miners etc. Don't get me wrong, I love new and unique races in Fantasy but I don't want the traditional ones to dissapear either.

What are your thoughts?"

444,Fantasy,Review and Fan Art: Burn the Dark by S.A. Hunt,"Robin is a YouTube celebrity with a very unusual channel: she hunts  witches. She’s gotten quite good at it over the years, but now it’s  finally time to face down the witches who matter the most, the ones who  killed her mother. But doing so requires returning to her home town and  confronting her past. 

This book mainly alternates between Robin’s point of view and the  point of view of Wayne, a young boy who has recently moved with his  father into Robin’s childhood home. There are also a smattering of other  POV chapters, including Robin’s childhood friend Joel (pronounced Jo-*el*)  and the sinister witches themselves.  Much more so than dealing with  witches and scary magic, Burn the Dark deals with heavy topics such as  living with trauma and racism and homophobia in the American South.

The characters are really where this novel shines. The diverse cast  all feel like real, three dimensional people with beautiful, messy  lives, and I would be happy to get to know any of them. Witchcraft and  hauntings aside, I wish that I could join Robin, Joel, Kenway, Fish, and  the others for movie night at the comic book store! The setting, too,  feels real and lived in, a struggling but overall pleasant small town  that seems like it would be a nice place to live or visit — except for  the whole evil witch thing.

Unfortunately, while I adored the setting and the characters, the  plot fell a little bit flat to me. Full caveat that I don’t usually read  a lot of horror, so Ms. Hunt might just be using tropes and conventions  that are unfamiliar to me. But it felt like there wasn’t really much of  a plot, just the characters being dragged from one creepy supernatural  occurrence to another, with very few steps taken towards their  ostensible goals. The ending also felt a bit rushed, and cut off just as  things were getting interesting. I don’t always mind cliff hangers or  sequel-bait, but it did feel a bit like a full novel of nothing but  setup. Also, it’s fully just a personal preference thing, but I tend to  gravitate towards novels where witches, dragons, etc are presented as  heroes rather than villains, and never quite enjoy the more traditional  evil witch stories as much. Nevertheless, I found the story to be  engaging throughout, and was never bored at any point while reading.

**The Fan Art**

Drawing Robin was probably the most fun part about this review, haha.  She’s just such a badass, cool looking character. Also in case it needs  saying, the rune on her pendant is not any kind of political or  religious statement, it is a thing from the book to help protect from  witches.

While they're certainly not masterful works of fantasy fiction, and they're not without their flaws (they're basically an unabashed poor man's Conan), I think they're really fun sword and sorcery reads for the most part. I'm about to start reading the last one, Thongor Fights the Pirates of Tarakus, and I was interested to see if these books have much of a fanbase on here!

(I also found out that a film of Thongor was almost made in the 70s, with production going as far as making models of the flying monsters/dinosaurs in the books. Had the film come into fruition, it would have predated Conan the Barbarian in the wonderful world of sword and sorcery cinema. I thought that was a fun fact, and it's a shame the movie was never made.)"

452,Fantasy,Thraxas by Martin Scott (AKA Martin Millar),"
Has anyone else read Thraxas by Martin Millar )under the pen name Martin Scott)? I love this series of books so much, yet I have never met another fan (in real life or online). The first book won best novel for the World Fantasy award 2000. 

It’s pulp fiction magical private investigator and funny as heck.  

The book description is:
“Welcome to the magical city of Turai. You might not like it here, however, for in Turai, the only people more corrupt than the politicians are the royal family, and murder and mayhem and ruthless criminal brotherhoods reign. With the civic guards incapable of keeping order, it's left to men like Thraxas to do what they can. The city needs men of steel, men of virtue and honesty and clean living. Unfortunately, Thraxas is none of the above.”

If you haven’t read this you really need to. The book is funny and silly and clever. The characters are brilliant. Thraxas is a private investigator who loves his beer, Maki is a bar-maid, warrior, half Orc -half elf ,student of philosphy and maths. Their relationship is brilliant, they squabble and support each other, get drunk, get stoned and solve crimes. The story doesn’t matter. The characters are great. The author’s voice is brilliant, he never takes you to where you think it’s going. He is original, and I love his books to bits.

I love all the books of Martin Millar (AKA Martin Scott). He also wrote Lonely werewolf Girl and The good fairies of New York. I cannot recommend them highly enough. I read high fantasy, low fantasy, Robin Hobb, Jasper Fford, George RR Martin, Neil Gaiman and Martin Millar fits well at that table. It is a mystery to me why some authors become popular and others don’t. Martin Millar should be up there there with the greats."

457,Fantasy,Book Review: Of Honey and Wildfires by Sarah Chorn,"The West is the home of shine, a substance which can power weapons and be used to do everything from preserving food to being used in medical treatment. The economy of the known world is starting to depend on shine. Ultra-rich businessman Matthew Esco has used mechanisms unknown to seal the shine fields away from rest of the world through the Boundary, through which he only controls access. He sends his son West to learn the ropes of business and prepare to take over from him, but Arlen is a very different sort of man. Meanwhile, a young girl named Cassandra grows up without her pa, a free spirit harbouring a personal grudge against the Esco family and determined to help liberate the Esco company's indentured workers.

Of Honey and Wildfires is the second novel from Sarah Chorn and is rather different to her first novel, *Seraphina's Lament*. Lament was a dark, bloody and grim book of collapsing empires and people with unusual powers rallying to a greater cause (for both good and ill). *Of Honey and Wildfires* is likewise a novel with epic ramifications across a continent, but it's also a much more personal story of acceptance, loss and struggle.

There is a tighter focus this time around, with the story dominated by the POVs of Arlen Esco and Cassandra (Cassandra's friend Ianthe gets some page-time as well), whose stories are linked although they do not know it. Cassandra's father, Chris, is a rebel trying to bring down the system and has been absent from most of her life due to the struggle, something they both regret. Early in the book Chris kidnaps Arlen, who is then made aware of the atrocities and sacrifices his father's company enacts in the name of profit.

There are exotic shine-powered weapons and displays of what appears to be magical power, but *Of Honey and Wildfires* is a novel much less interested in the typical trappings of fantasy than it is in character. Each character is explored in impressive depth over the course of modest page count (the book barely cracks 300 pages), stripped back to their soul with their motivations laid bare. It's a gradual process in some cases, with the non-linear storytelling (which moves between events in the present and many years ago) helping with the deconstruction of the protagonists.

That's not to say that worldbuilding and plot are neglected. Chorn carefully builds up the world and the rules of how it works through the story and characters, creating a vivid setting. I was particularly impressed at how naturally the plot - which seemed to be developing quite slowly with the page limit counting down - came together in the last few pages when it looked like quite a lot would be left hanging. The plot construction of the novel is highly impressive given its focus on the characters. It's also good to see another novel joining the still small but growing ""Fantasy Western"" subgenre.

*Of Honey and Wildfires* (\*\*\*\*\*) is a book about trauma and about how childhood decisions and absences shape lives and destinies and identities. It's a short, emotionally raw novel showcasing formidable writing talent, and after the promising (if slightly less polished) debut of *Seraphina's Lament*, it's baffling why the author hasn't been picked up by a major publisher yet."

For the lucky scientists selected by the Destination Mars! corporation, a one-way ticket to Mars—in exchange for a lifetime of research—had been an absolute no-brainer. The incredible opportunity was clearly worth even the most absurdly tedious screening process.

468,Fantasy,The Name of the Wind - Patrick Rothfuss,"I know I'm late to this party, but I just finished this book after getting it for Christmas, and I thought I'd share my impressions on it.

The Name of the Wind is the first in the Kingkiller Chronicle, and revolves around a man named Kvothe, who has become a living legend through various adventures. The framing device is that a chronicler seeks him out in order to write down the definitive story of Kvothe's life. With some reluctance Kvothe agrees, and the main narrative is a first-person account of the past, intercut with scenes from the present as Kvothe, the chronicler, and a few other characters interact in between accounts.

Kvothe insists on telling everything; all the things that shaped him into the man he would become. So he begins with his boyhood as a part of an ethnic group of wandering performers. It is in this life that he first encounters magic, and that a mage/scholar is the first to point out just how intellectually gifted Kvothe is. Events eventually leave the boy alone to face a harsh world, and for several years his entire being is simply focused on the task of surviving harrowing circumstances.

With age and ever-growing intelligence he pulls himself together, and scrapes together the means to seek out and attend the setting's legendary university of... well, from what I can tell, *everything*. Including magic. The majority of the book is then about his formative years in academia, where friends, foes, difficulties, danger and learning gradually shape him into the legend he will become.

But on to my personal opinion:

What do I think? I have to admit I'm slightly conflicted. Several of the elements of this story aren't really for me, such as magic being, essentially a science, while I prefer it to be more otherworldly and mysterious. Academia also doesn't exactly thrill me. And the way that seemingly every single one of Kvothe's victories and accomplishments in the face of great odds are immediately followed by a setback or punishment of some sort started to feel just a bit sadistic after a while.

But a particular piece of media not being entirely to my tastes doesn't mean I can't tell that it is expertly crafted, and I am in awe of Rothfuss's worldbuilding talents. And I don't mean a huge backstory that one character monologues about; I mean the way he weaves huge amounts of lore throughout the narrative. It all feels *real*, and so do the people. While Kvothe encounters a lot of ignorance, cruelty and general human shittiness, Rothfuss doesn't wallow in grimdark, and Kvothe ALSO meets human kindness in the journey of his life, from friends and strangers alike. I'd say it all balances out.

As for Kvothe himself, he is definitely engaging enough to carry a first-person narrative. I'd say he's an excellent example of doing a highly gifted character without going overboard with it. I know that he will grow into a warrior badass, but since the first book's account takes place before all that he has to rely on his intelligence rather than sword. And as much as I appreciate a good fight scene, a cunning plan well executed is entertaining in its own right. All in all Kvothe is definitely extraordinary, but he is also definitely human.

**TL;DR**: The Name of the Wind is very well written and shows off a thoroughly living and convincing setting. I think anyone gifted with a bit more patience than me will fall utterly in love with it."

470,Fantasy,The Violence of the Lamb: a Review of Joe Abercrombie's Red Country,"&gt;Evil turned out not to be a grand  thing. Not sneering Emperors with their world-conquering designs. Not  cackling demons plotting in the darkness beyond the world. It was small  men with their small acts and their small reasons. It was selfishness  and carelessness and waste. It was bad luck, incompetence, and  stupidity. It was violence divorced from conscience or consequence. It  was high ideals, even, and low methods.

By this point, I have read all the standalone books between Mr Abercrombie’s first *First Law* trilogy and his second *First Law* trilogy, and my esteem for this author only grew ever higher. *Best Served Cold* was a powerful revenge fantasy set in the Italy of the First Law world. *The Heroes*  is a multifaceted military story which succeeded in giving depth to  both sides of a conflict while also digging deeply into the very concept  of heroism itself. *Sharp Ends*, which was published after *Red Country*,  is a delightful collection of short stories which explores the  backstories and fates of multiple memorable characters which appeared in  all of Mr Abercrombie’s books, with a connected series of chapters  following the compelling (and oft hilarious) adventures of the thief  Shevediah and the muscleheaded, comically horny Javre as they Forrest  Gumped their way through many major events in the *First Law* world.

*Red Country* is set in the Near Country and Far Country west  of Starikland, but functionally, they represent the lawless frontier  region of the American Wild West—so yeah, this book is Mr Abercrombie  writing a western, yee-haw! The story follows Shy South who lives on a  farmstead with her cowardly stepfather, Lamb, when a band of outlaws  burned their farm down, murdered an old family friend, and kidnapped her  two younger siblings. This kicked off an epic chase by Shy and Lamb  across the country to rescue the children, and in their journey, it  became increasingly obvious that Lamb is not the man Shy thought he was  (though longtime *First Law* fans would immediately recognise  this particular very large, very strong and very scarred old Northman). I  could tell that Mr Abercrombie was having a ball of a time playing with  Western tropes. There are cattle drives, prospectors participating in a  gold rush, and raids by indigenous natives who take trophies of their  victims by cutting off ~~scalps~~ ears. More specifically, it seemed  to me that Mr Abercrombie was paying homage to spaghetti westerns by  Sergio Leone. Lamb falls easily into the role of the Man with No Name as  he plays a pivotal role in a frontier town torn apart by two feuding  gangs like in *A Fistful of Dollars*, with one of the faction’s  leader being another favourite from Abercrombie’s previous books. Heck  there is even a Mexican standoff in this book over stolen gold, another  send up of another Sergio Leone film, *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*.

As I have always said, my favourite aspect of Mr Abercrombie’s  writing is his undisputed skill in crafting memorable, believable,  sympathetic characters. Through some of his authorial alchemy, his new  characters like Shy South and Temple felt as just familiar to me as his  older ones from previous books like Lamb, Nicomo Cosca, Friendly, and  Glama Golden. And I think that part of the secret sauce is in how every  character felt like they have really lived. New characters like Shy and  Temple have obvious pasts that they constantly make references to, and  their histories clearly inform their choices and their actions in the  present; while the characters who had already appeared in previous books  (and thus already possess inbuilt backstories) act consistently with  what we have learned of them before as well. For example, I adore how  Abercrombie depicts Lamb as someone who avoids conflicts and  confrontations as much as he can, leading to his stepdaughter Shy in  thinking him a bloody coward, but those of us who knew him from the  original trilogy knows another reason for his seemingly craven  behaviour. This is the sort of layered storytelling that so many authors  attempt but rarely achieve at the level of mastery Abercrombie  demonstrates. Abercrombie characters may not always be three-dimensional  (some have just one or two defining characteristics), but what they do  have in spades is depth.

Just like *Best Served Cold*, which delivered a satisfying  standalone story while giving us a good look into a previously  unexamined corner of the Circle of the World, *Red Country*  achieved the same in setting up tantalising things to come in future  books in both geopolitical and technological sense. And now that we are  on the topic of world-building, I also noticed that Mr Abercrombie’s  “Ghosts”, which are stand-ins for Native Americans in *Red Country*,  were described as being red haired and pale skinned to avoid the  politically incorrect stereotype of savage injuns common in the western  genre. I don’t know if he is fooling anyone with that but I guess he is  expending some effort there. It is, after all, an improvement over his  depiction of the dark-skinned Gurkish (his fantasy equivalent of Middle  Easterners) who follow the teaching of a “Prophet” depicted as (yikes) a  cannibal running a magical anthropophagic cult.

*Red Country* is a story about shady pasts and redemptions. It  is an exploration on the concept of identities. It is a tale of a  thrilling adventure undertaken by flawed but well-meaning people facing  impossible odds. It will make you laugh along the way, and it may even  make you cry by the end. If you have never read a single *First Law*  book before, you can start here because it is a fine tale on its own,  but reading it after reading all the preceding volumes will magnify your  enjoyment significantly.

P.S. I experienced this work through an audiobook, and Steven Pacey’s narration remains top form. As I have said in [my review of *Best Served Cold*](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/12/14/murcattos-seven-and-her-grand-tour-of-revenge-and-mayhem-a-review-of-joe-abercrombies-best-served-cold/), this is the best way to consume Abercrombie’s writings.

**The three elves and the fly.**

Once upon a time, there were three elves.

They were all easy twelves.

The elves in speak,

were going to have a leak.

So they strolled down to the creek,

to have said leak.

Once at the creek, they found a golden leek.

The leek was quite magnificent,

with its utterly magic scent.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the elves randomly whispered:

‘’That is why pigs don’t fly!’’

But then there came a fly.

The fly was a Russian spy.

Another elf uttered:

‘’Who is that commie swine?’’

The commie fly took a sip of his fine wine and answered:

‘’My name is Nikolai.’’

And boy, was that Russian fly.

&amp;#x200B;

But all of a sudden,

One of the elves buttoned up his bottom button.

And the fly commie swine Nikolai was shocked,

so instinctively, he dropped his Glock.

But shouldn’t a Russian have a Makarov?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow,

At the same time

one of the elves saw some thyme.

He wondered:

‘’Was Nikolai’s fine wine *that* fine?’’

And boy, was that a good question.

&amp;#x200B;

Nikolai saw the sight,

and sighed:

‘’No’’.

But it was a night unlike any other,

so the elves studied the face of their new-found Russian brother.

And boy, was that a blunder.

&amp;#x200B;

So the Russian fly Nikolai went to cover his mistake,

which was honestly a piece of cake.

He then picked up his Glock,

which actually was a flintlock,

and put the key in the flintlocks lock.

His gun was now unlocked.

&amp;#x200B;

And then one of the elves said,

in a quite frightening way:

‘’I am bigger and better than you!’’.

And even though the Russian spy Nikolai knew

that if the plan the elves planned went through,

that is, the coup they drew,

he could review his new clue

with his good pal, Hugh the Jew, in Peru.

&amp;#x200B;

But you already knew the clue.

It is the magnificent golden leek at the creek!

&amp;#x200B;

And so began the war!

Where the Russian fly Nikolai and the three elves swore:

‘’Do not go to the shore!’’

Because

the shore of the creek which had the golden leek,

was not going to be like an antique greek war week!

&amp;#x200B;

Thereupon,

The commie swine Nikolai got his clue,

so he went to see his good pal, Hugh the Jew!

And the elves, who were all easy twelves, had their leak,

and consequently started an antique greek war week!

&amp;#x200B;

Thus this fairytale is now finished,

because the protagonists of the story got their wishes, who were never mentioned,

granted by a wizard who was never mentioned.

Hence, they lived happily ever after."

474,Fantasy,"I finished Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn... what about the sequels?","Well... that took a bit longer than I expected. I have to admit there were some really slow parts, and I could imagine the books to be shorter. But overall the series is amazing. It truly gave me the Tolkien feelings, but towards the end I could clearly see what inspired GRR Martin. 

Simon will probably not become part of my ""all-time favourite characters"" but I realy liked Binabik, and enjoyed reading Miriamele and Isgrimnur. 

Now, I will take a break and eventually hope to jump into the sequel (preferably when all three are out). Question for you: is the writing similar to this or has Tad evolved in some ways?"
475,Fantasy,Sea fantasy,"Hi guys, my gf and I would love to read a fantasy novel or a series set in the sea. Is it with pirate, voyagers, elves or men it doesn't really matter as long as there are ships, sea shanty, a lot of alcohol and some fantasy element to spicy things up
I know I gave little details but really we're fascinated with the idea of a fantasy tale narrated with the sea sounds as soundtrack (and I'm not talking about audiobooks)"
476,Fantasy,Did Anyone Ever Read Darren Shan?,"I see a lot of people mention Percy Jackson and Skulduggery Pleasant around here but never Darren Shan. 

He did a young adult series called the Demonata  about teenagers travelling to different worlds to battle demons. I remember loving these books as a teenager and I’m really surprised they don’t get mentioned more! 

He also wrote another series about a teenager who becomes a vampire which had a very fantasy feel to it, lots of original fantasy creatures and I remember in one of the books he was even transported to a post apocalyptic land. 

Anyway I’d definitely recommend giving these a look to anyone who this sounds interesting to. The best way I could describe him is a young adult Clive Barker."
477,Fantasy,Science Fantasy Recommendations,So I kinda like the idea of Science Fantasy. I grew up liking Star Wars and more recently I found JRPGs like Xenoblade Chronicles and Star Ocean (which is the quintessential Science Fantasy series in gaming) really captivating. Are there any Science Fantasy books you guys would recommend?

480,Fantasy,The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss," 

***A tale that makes you feel a thousand emotions profoundly. A story you are not likely to forget***  


I had heard nothing but polarizing reviews for this book. Some loved it immensely to spin songs about it, some apparently carry a vehement dislike for this book. And while I understand the latter, I have to say I have joined the ranks of the former group, albeit without the lyrical skill.  


So how do I sum this book up? It's not an easy thing. Because my lack of wit would not do justice to this tale. But I will deign to try.  


Have you ever walked across a street, content in your life, and you just happen to glance at a thing, anything, in a glass showcase? Hmm, looks intriguing, a well designed model ship perhaps, but then you think better of it and leave for your day. You walk by this same boat again, only now you are marveled by the outrageousness of the price and walk away with a huff. Several days later, you are needed someplace and you walk by the boat again, only this time, you realize that its sails are possibly the most gorgeous thing you've ever seen, but then, its not for you. A friend of yours invite you to his house and you happen to see this particular little boat there, and your gracious host weaves wonder and mystery surrounding this little boat, with its rosewood hull and its sculpted masts, and you want to know what it feels like, to be an owner of such a craft. After tossing and turning, against all better judgement, you indulge and buy this boat, lest you change your mind again.  


At the first glance amongst your belongings, you immediately regret it and curse your unreliable whim. The sails are pasty, the wood dark. But lo, behold, you stumble upon a scroll inside this boat, and the scroll tells the stories and the adventures that this vessel has endured. You are fascinated. You laugh at the places where this ship blunders, you marvel at the sights this ships goes to. You are lost, you are aware of that. The stories of this miniature vessel has ensconced you. You learn names, you befriend people, there is wind in the air, and you are just...*lost*. It's like finding a missing piece.  


***It's like finding home.***  


Maybe I stretched it far with the ship, but I couldn't better express myself than this, even if I try. I expected to not like this book, because I am a pessimist at heart. Maybe that's why I was astounded when I found myself laughing at a certain dialogue that took place. I realized I was nose deep into the story and I didn't want to come for air.  


I am in no ways a musician, but I do play guitar. I cherish this instrument in my heart. I don't give it the attention it deserves, I don't play its worth. But when I do play, I am a completely different person. I want to strike melodies as my fingers move through the frets. I want to scour hearts with the ballads I expel from this instrument. And all this I resonated with Kvothe. Yes, he is a stone-headed fool sometimes, behind the robes of an immaculate genius and know-it-all. The boy seems to have picked up the wrong lessons on certain occasions, but then again, when have we ever in our lives picked a right lesson that has left us satisfied? But you understand. I did. Okay, maybe I empathized with him, given his circumstances (he has been through things), but...  


But...  


I felt pain in my gut when he was torn from his lute. I rejoiced with him when he got it back. I raged hell when he lost it again. Because music was his identity. It is; this isn't some poetic nonsense. He was born of musicians and music helped him find solace, something which I know. And for that alone I adore this book. But there are other praises to come.  


This world is rich, palpable and vibrant, one of the reasons why I was lost in this book. Its structure is familiar and yet unknown. The places comes with their own spotlights and it amazed me. And the writing...it isn't distinctive. No. It's engrossing. Perhaps the only fitting word is *beautiful*. Rothfuss knows how to transport you to a different world, and he succeeded doing that wonderfully. I do not want to write on the characters because this is Kvothe's story, and I would like to maintain it like that.  


If I am allowed to be nit-picky, I would say that characters aren't Rothfuss's thing. For the most part, they were generic, even Kvothe, but the story is just that interesting that you lose sight of that. There were sporadic reminders of our main protagonists' poverty which I found a little gratuitous and overdone, but that gradually resolved as the book progressed. The interludes, very initially, were pretty jarring to cut back to, because you switch to a different narrative style, different setting, a very different time in a span of a sentence, but even that was resolved as the story went.  


In the beginning pages of this book, it felt like reading a Dickensian novel (which should say something because I've only read one); an orphan child, living in the streets, finds a purpose...the whole shebang. Then it took a turn and it became your typical school setting; make enemies, make friends, find the weird teacher and have bouts with the teacher you hate. Another turn, and now your living in a musical. Yet another turn and you might have just found the love of your life. And still, another arc and it is an adventure. As my mind was taking a stroll through all these storylines, I realized why this was a well loved book. It is basically goodness in a platter.  


This atmosphere, these friendships that we witness, I felt them as homing beacons, calling me out to taste the richness that is just within my reach. I wanted to experience them all, stake my claim. Because that is what this book is...an experience. A journey...towards home. If you, like me, came to love this book, you'll realizes it for what it is. *A sweet and gentle promise of home.*

481,Fantasy,What is your philosophy on buying a different edition of a book you already own?,Would you still buy a special edition hardback of a book you really like if you already own a paper back copy of the book?
482,Fantasy,Should I read The Broken Earth after having finished the cosmere and the Kingkiller chronicles? Is there something better that some of you might recommend?,This may sound like a weird question but I think the order of the books matters when forming opinions about a book. Sanderson’s stories were so immersive that I still feel the withdrawal symptoms. I saw the Broken Earth is ranked pretty high so I just wanted what people’s opinion about it is
483,Fantasy,I'm looking for fantasy novel series to read.,I've recently picked up reading again after a long time of not reading. I've recently picked up a series called the Faithful and the Fallen by John Gwynne. I rather enjoyed the series and I'm now looking for series to read whether it's high fantasy or something in the middle (if that makes sense). I've had a friend recommended the Wheel of Time series to me so I wanted to make a list so I can keep going. I forgot how much I love reading.
484,Fantasy,Good obscure fantasy books?,"So far I’ve read a lot of series but I’m not the most well read. I read Harry Potter back in the fifth grade and remember less than half the details. But recently I got into reading when I started reading stormlight. 

And as I increased my collection I realized I was going off of well known and popular series, even if some were older than others. And I still haven’t read half my collection yet. 

But my point is that I really would like to diversify. So could you guys give me some more obscure fantasy book recommendations? They don’t have to be obscure so much as something that’s not ultra-popular and something you’d find in a top 10 fantasy series list."
485,Fantasy,I found i series very similar to super powereds,"It’s called see these bones the beginning of the book is absolutely awful hated it but once he gets to the school it’s gets good and gets very similar to super powereds.

I love MTG, and would like some books who are about knights beating up dragons, goblins or whatever, just something that ressembles MTG. Do you have any suggestions for me?"
492,Fantasy,Trying to read Six of Crows but this one thing is really holding me back...,"I've noticed this happens in a lot of YA books and I'm curious why. 

These characters are all about 16-18, and have violent tragic backstories, bucketloads of trauma, the personalities and mentalities of much older adults, and are these super talented and feared crime bosses. 

That's just... so ridiculous. Why did the author make them literal children? I see no reason why these characters couldn't have been more in the range of 18-25, which is genuinely ""young adults."" 

Is there some unspoken rule that to be marketed as YA, the characters have to be under 20? Heck, even if these people were 19, it wouldn't be as immersion-breaking as trying to imagine 16 year olds running around murdering people and pulling off complicated dangerous heists.

To add on to this, the author almost completely avoids any reference or inclusion of sexual activity? Why? I'm supposed to believe these kids are so independent, so self-aware, and yet *aren't* having sex? Again... it's ridiculous. 

I want to enjoy the story but can't help but think how much better it would be if the characters weren't children."
493,Fantasy,Need mature novel series.,Don't much care where it takes place or what the plot is. I only ask that it has no romance or snarky teenagers and if does have a snarky teenager that he or she dies. If there is a dog sidekick that's even better
494,Fantasy,Starting reading Innkeeper Chronicles....,"....and I love it!!  A fun, easy, enjoyable read.  
Fun fact, the author Ilona Andrews is actually a pen name of a husband and wife duo.  Ilona &amp; Andrew Gordon.

If you’re looking for and urban fantasy/science fiction read I recommend it"
495,Fantasy,Any good science fiction AND fantasy recommendations? (Like something that kinda combines both creatively?),"I'm talking straight up Star Trek meets Stormlight Archive kinda thing.

I wish more fantasy books that are part of a wider trilogy did this. A simple summary of what happened in the previous book (though I suppose in Sanderson's case the summary would be an additional book).

It's really handy for those who don't get a chance to re-read the previous book before a new release."

Bonus question, which magic do you think it's cooler, from the books/movies/games or whatever?

Thank you!!"
503,Fantasy,A Memory Called Empire - Does it get better?,"I've heard extremely positive things about this book, but I'm not getting it.  I'm about 200 pages into it and it's been really dry and difficult to understand so far.  I'm not sure what the actual plot is supposed to be.  It's mostly been people reciting poetry and responding to emails about the interesting things happening on the other side of the galaxy."
504,Fantasy,Books like Red Rising / Fast paced fantasy or sci fi,"I love the red rising series, and I was looking for recommendations that have a similar pacing - I’ve never read anything thats so relentless and non stop!"
505,Fantasy,First timer finishing bingo. Interesting to see where I was when finishing each book (and how awful I am at taking photos of books!),"So, I'm in a book of the month kind of thing where a lovely independent book store sends me a great fantasy book every month. By August I realized I had everything but 4 squares done without even focusing my reading on the bingo. The rest of the squares took forever and because of the big internet bookstore messing up, my Ace/aro book is not gonna make it in time so substitution it is.

Not good about the whole review thing but I'll try my best to have some comment about each book.

**First Row Across:**

* **Novel Translated from its Original Language** (**HARD MODE) - Not before sundown - Johanna Sinisalo.** Originally in Finnish. About a man who finds a troll cub and keeps it in his apartment. A bit heavy on the mythology in the beginning but the story is lovely.
* **Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold** (**HARD MODE) - The left hand of darkness - Ursula K. Le Guin.** Well, a classic I guess. Enjoyed it.
* **Optimistic SFF** (**HARD MODE) - No country for old gnomes - Delilah S. Dawson, Kevin Hearne.** Fantasy parody? Funny and a light easy read.
* **Novel Featuring Necromancy** **- Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel - Susanna Clarke .** Sorry, hated every page of it, don't understand the hype. Slow and boring for me. 
* **~~Ace / Aro Spec Fic~~** **/ SFF Novel Featuring an Ocean Setting - The bright and breaking sea - Chloe Neill.** British navy with magic. Go kill some pirates!

**Second Row Across:**

* **Novel Featuring a Ghost - The eterna files - Leanna Renee Hieber.** Trying to find the answer to eternal life in a race between the British and the Americans in the 1800s. I started this before and lost interest halfway through. Same this time but kept going to be able to include in bingo. Sorry, not doing it for me.
* **Novel Featuring Exploration (HARD MODE) - At the mountains of madness - H.P. Lovecraft.** I was on a classics spree last summer. This creeped me out.
* **Climate Fiction - The windup girl - Paolo Bacigalupi.** Bangkok is flooded, food is scarce and everything is chaos. I liked it!
* **Novel with a Colour in the Title (HARD MODE) - Silver in the wood - Emily Tesh (+ Drowned country).** I read the complete duology, Silver in the wood is quite short but the atmosphere is amazing.
* **Any** [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) **Book Club Book of the Month OR** [r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) **Read-along Book - The ten thousand doors of January - Alix E- Harrow.** Nope, sorry, don't get the hype on this one either. Predictable and some times the plot just don't make sense  &gt;!WHY carve words in your arm when you can just write on the floor??? Oh very fancy to just add a word and change the meaning but still makes no sense... And why am I still pissed about this?!&lt;  

**Third Row Across:**

* **Self-Published SFF Novel - Never die - Rob J. Hayes.** Clever story but way to many fighting scenes for me. I find them boring in all books.
* **Novel with Chapter Epigraphs (HARD MODE) - Black sun - Rebecca Roanhorse.** I liked it :)
* **Novel Published in 2020 - Plan for the worst - Jodi Taylor.** It's St Mary's, does it need more description than that? Time travel, tea and everything crazy you could imagine.
* **Novel Set in a School or University (HARD MODE) - Equal rites - Terry Pratchett.** Yes, you can have a female wizard! I'm on a Pratchett audio book binge while trying to exercise to loose 15 kg.
* **Book About Books - The binding - Bridget Collins.** A pleasant surprise. Better than I thought from the cover. Young man learns the art of binding books and falls in love.

**Fourth Row Across:**

* **A Book that Made You Laugh (HARD MODE) - Hollow kingdom - Kira Jane Buxton.** Zombie apocalypse and the only one left to save the day is a crow. 
* **Five SFF Short Stories (HARD MODE) - Unpossible and other stories - Daryl Gregory.** I think I have to call him my favorite author, weird, wonderful and engaging. 
* **Big Dumb Object (HARD MODE?) - The war of the worlds - H. G. Wells.** A classic, not sure if it counts for hard mode. But a big dumb object does appear, no one really understands that they should be worried at first.
* **Feminist Novel - The beauty - Aliya Whiteley (Or the inheritance trilogy by N. K. Jemisin).** The beauty is short but so very strange and gender bending. All the women died and the men tries to live on. I did read the whole inheritance trilogy but if nothing of this counts I'll just use The left hand of darkness for this and The girl in the tower by Katherine Arden for the snow/ice square.
* **Novel by a Canadian Author - Spellslinger - Sebastien De Castell.** Magic! Or lack of magic maybe...

**Fifth Row Across:**

* **Novel with a Number in the Title - Sixteen ways to defend a walled city - K. J. Parker.** If you can't win when you play by the rules, why play by the rules? Unwilling engineer defends a city under siege.
* **Romantic Fantasy / Paranormal Romance - The beast's heart - Leife Shallcross.** Beauty and the Beast retelling. Romance really isn't my thing but it was okay.
* **Novel with a Magical Pet (HARD MODE) - Clockwork city - Paul Crilley.** Talking dog-demon-thing. Not really sure. Somehow missed that this was part 2 in a series and I felt a bit lost reading it.
* **Format: Graphic Novel (at least 1 vol.) (HARD MODE) - Sing no evil - JP Ahonen, KP Alare.** Finnish musical fantasy. Nice story and good drawings. The creator of the Belzebubs comic.
* **Novel Featuring Politics (HARD MODE?) - Priest of lies - Peter McLean.** Mostly no royalty. Gangster getting dragged in to national politics against his will. Also read the first book Priest of bones. Nice but very dark."
506,Fantasy,Recommendation for a good Series,"I used to read a lot of fantasy books, but, ever since I started University, I stopped reading them. I don’t know exactly why...
Anyway, I’m looking to start reading them and I’m looking for a good place to start.

Any recommendations?

Some of my favourites include: Falling Kingdoms Series by Morghan Rhodes, Throne of Glass Series by Sarah J. Mass, the Young Elites Series by Marie Lu, Legend series by Marie Lu, Blackcoat Rebellion (Pawn) Series by Aimee Carter, and The Testing Trilogy by Joelle Charbonneau.

Personally prefer a nice romance in the mix.

510,Fantasy,First time doing Bingo -- and I completed every square! Short reviews of all books.,"This is my first year doing the [Book Bingo challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ft254j/official_rfantasy_2020_book_bingo_challenge/) so I might have messed up somewhere, but I wanted to list the books I read and brief thoughts about them. I'll go more in-depth on some of them in separate threads. 

First Row:

Translation: [Becoming the Dragon by Alex Sapegin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36697312-becoming-the-dragon): This book was fine. It wasn't something I either loved or hated. I think it was translated from Russian, if I'm correct, and the storyline felt a bit fragmented. It's a portal fantasy about a boy who's sucked into another dimension and has to survive with nothing, and in some cases being unable to communicate. I felt that several of the scenes were unnecessary and didn't really like the main character much, but the dragon was interesting. 

Ice/Snow: [Nocturnal Blood by Villemy Mist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43085187-nocturnal-blood): This is a vampire story set in Canada. I'm not usually one for vampire stories, but the main character's struggle with OCD, anxiety, and bullying was definitely sympathetic. When her one friend from high school suddenly drops into her life after years of absence, Leia becomes embroiled in a battle to survive, with her only hope being a vampire. 

Optimistic: [The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22733729-the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet): I loved this book. I loved the diversity of alien races, I loved the characters, and I loved how no matter what happened they stuck with each other and found brightness. Found family themes rock, and they were huge in this book, and bonus points for making me laugh out loud. Definitely check it out!

Necromancy: [Bad Witch Burning by Jessica Lewis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50028605-bad-witch-burning): This book is powerful and gripping. Katrell's struggle with poverty, with her emotionally abusive mom and her mom's physically abusive boyfriend-of-the-month are rooted in real issues, but Katrell can summon the dead, and she's hoping this is her ticket to financial freedom. Katrell is an amazing character backed up by the ever-awesome Will, her best friend. I got this as an ARC, but once it comes out (August 24th, 2021) definitely check it out!

Aro/Ace: [Cute Mutants by SJ Whitby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54275754-cute-mutants-vol-1): This one's another awesome book! Dylan is a snarky high schooler who wishes the comic book life were easier to live. It's not easy being in high school, able to talk to objects, but without good social skills. How's she supposed to gather a functional mutant team to take down the strange mutant who's running around stealing like that?   


Second Row:

Ghosts: [Daughter of Shades by Sylvia Mercedes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51063468-daughter-of-shades): This one is like a female Witcher, and I really enjoyed that. Ayleth is possessed by a shade, giving her magic but also setting her apart from the people who live in the medieval-fantasy-esque land. She's a huntress who wants to rise in the ranks of the Holy Order, but chafes at the restrictions placed on her by her mentor. This was a fast-paced action-adventure sort of book with interesting magic and cool characters.

Exploration: [The Warded Man by Peter Brett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3428935-the-warded-man): At night, demons come. The people use wards to protect their houses and huddle inside, save from the ravenous hunger and destruction of the corelings--for as long as the wards hold, anyway. But that's not enough for our protagonist, who dares to venture out beyond the town, beyond the wards, to find a way to beat the corelings so his people don't have to hunker down in shelters every night. This was ok, but I wished the female characters had more agency and more goals beyond becoming mothers. 

Climate Fiction: [Daughters of Nri by Reni Amayo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44563376-daughters-of-nri): The Goddess was killed, and the old gods are dead. Eze Ochichiri rules--and destroys--the land at his whims. But even though Eze killed the Goddess, she left him a surprise: twins embued with her power that can call on the land to aid them. This was an interesting book but the pacing felt off to me. I really liked the comparison of ecology and living with the land vs subduing and conquering it though. 

Color: [The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29774026-the-priory-of-the-orange-tree): I was disappointed by this book. For one, I was interested in a character that didn't get much screentime, and I didn't like two of the four main POV characters. And I really wanted more priory, because that was really interesting. I did like the dragons, though I'd have rather them not be painted in such a wide brush, but the presence of good dragons and bad dragons both was interesting. 

Book Club: [Inda by Sherwood Smith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222837.Inda): I loved this one. Inda is an interesting character and I loved the departure from medieval-esque fantasy to more of a spartan type system. The battle school, the politics and betrayals and various power-hungry factions were all combined into a gripping tale I wanted more of but also wanted to just bask in the after-glow of.   


Third Row:

Self-published: [Seasons of Albadone by Christopher Warman and Élan Marché](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55436453-seasons-of-albadone): This was fine. It's an interweaving tale with an unusual structure, as different protagonists pick up the story at different points in time, all sort of following along with the ripples of effects from the previous. It just didn't really grab my attention very well. 

Epigraphs: [The Brightest Shadow by Sarah Lin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51083937-the-brightest-shadow?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=Dk4oHH7NKn&amp;rank=1): I enjoyed this tale, though I thought the pace was a little slow. I really enjoyed the different perspectives and the new and interesting setting. Tani was probably my favorite, but I also liked several of the others, and the mansthein were interesting. It definitely has some progression elements as Tani and several of the others spend a lot of time working to better their skills and unlock new techniques. 

Published in 2020: [Elemental by Whitney Hill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52658399-elemental?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=XOnsNHyKV7&amp;rank=1): This one is awesome! It starts out the Shadows of the Otherside series and is set in North Carolina, USA, present day. Arden is an Elemental who has to hide who she is, lest the elves find out and kill her. Everyday humans don't know about the vampires, werewolves, djinn, and elves living among them, and members of Otherside largely want to keep it that way. But it's hard to avoid elves when they hire Arden as a private investigator. By the way, if you enjoy this book, you'll want to check out Three Mages and a Martini (also a short review below), and vice verse. 

School Setting: [The Order of the Key by Justine Manzano](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52554076-the-order-of-the-key?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=RSEfgexXas&amp;rank=1): This one's another awesome one! I loved Jackie, the main character. Set in the contemporary world again, Jackie struggles to keep her mom and sister safe when the shadowy organization her parents left years ago (after her dad died) comes back to claim them. Jackie's supposed to be a warrior among them, with her sister's task being to keep her safe by sacrificing herself if necessary, and rebel Jackie's having none of that!

About Books: The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern: I enjoyed this but didn't adore it. I did really enjoy the bees and the books and the hidden entrances, but sometimes the plot was a little convoluted for me and I didn't feel as close to the characters as I would live, probably because I was distracted trying to figure everything out. Overall though, an interesting read.   


Fourth Row: 

Laugh: [Sol Invictus by Ben Gartner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54837789-sol-invictus?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=wsYSdDGdBq&amp;rank=1): This is a middle-grade book geared toward kids graduating from Magic Treehouse books, and it combines history and fantasy in an interesting tale that enriches history lessons. It made my kids (and I) roar with laughter, and we enjoyed trying the ancient Roman recipe at the end. 

Short Stories: The ones who walk away from Omelas by Ursula K LeGuin, The ones who stay and fight by NK Jemisin, Standardized by R. Lee Fryar, Welcome to your Authentic Indian Experience by Rebecca Roanhorse, The Jester by Michael J Sullivan

Big Dumb Object: [Darkwind by Renee Dugan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54778808-darkwind?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=bEfJwOVhxY&amp;rank=2): This is the beginning of an epic fantasy series set in a mostly-analogous-to-medieval world, but the characters really bring it alive. I really enjoyed it, and I'm not going to spoil the Big Dumb Object but if you enjoy character focus, learning inner strength, and enemies-to-friends you should really read this book!

Feminist: [Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34494.The_Wee_Free_Men?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=sH833zADsA&amp;rank=1): This was excellent. I read it to my kids and they were always hungry for more. I put it in this square though because it caused one of my kids to go on a feminist rant and how important equal opportunities were no matter who you are. 

Canadian: [Witchmark by CL Polk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36187110-witchmark?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=mviUfJnPEp&amp;rank=1): I very much enjoyed this. It's kind of gaslamp fantasy, though the setting timeframe is a bit wrong for that, but the main character was someone I could easily attach to and I was hooked into his troubles every twist and turn of the way. And the ending was awesome!  


Fifth Row:

Number: [Three Mages and a Margarita by Annette Marie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39676313-three-mages-and-a-margarita?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=EqqHcTLNrP&amp;rank=1): This is another contemporary fantasy, and it was so good and so funny I immediately went and binged the rest of the series. Tori is kick-ass even if she's the only one with no magic. Like Elemental, it involves a world of magic, vampires, werewolves, etc living side-by-side with humans, unbeknownst to the humans--except for Tori, who's just too darn stubborn to walk away. By the way, if you enjoy this book, you'll want to check out Elemental (also a short review above), and vice verse. 

Romance: [Silver and Blood by Trina Talma](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7629114-silver-and-blood?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=AAIgfsMtzG&amp;rank=1): This was an interesting book with a series of romances in it. The main character lives in a walled city and learns to be a thief. But when her partner disappears, she has to go find him, and on the search, she discovers life outside the walls and the opportunities that abound there. Her choices hinge on the main romance. I enjoyed it even though I don't normally love romances, but it held my attention.

Magic Pet: [The Techno Mage by SW Raine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54867208-the-techno-mage): This was a cool steampunk book with alchemy and golems (and the golems are said magic pet). The narrative felt a bit disjointed between the three main characters for me, but I still enjoyed it!

Graphic Novel: [Raising Dragons by Bryan Davis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23218508-raising-dragons-graphic-novel?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=8T4ebTH43F&amp;rank=2): This one I did not enjoy. It was too preachy. 

Politics: [City of Brass by SA Chakraborty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32718027-the-city-of-brass): Loved this one! I enjoyed the interesting Egyptian setting, and the characters were very cool. This one gets a lot of talk, and it deserves it all. This was another where I finished the first book and couldn't help but pick up the next. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hey, you made it to the end! Bonus points for you, lol. Anyway, I hope this might highlight some cool books you might otherwise not know about, and maybe pick up."

I try to internalize the names of the lands and cities and pay attention to the shown terrain. I often imagine possible trade or travel routes, and at depictions of cities, the architecture, the difference between high and low class, also the relationships between different factions.

I don't feel really comfortable with actually reading until I can see myself walking through the streets or traveling across the land. It may not be the actual purpose of the map, but I enjoy doing so, sometimes more than reading the actual wordbuilding. Does anybody else have similar feelings?"

518,Fantasy,My r/Fantasy 2021 Bingo Card,"Managed 80% (20 of 25 squares) in hard mode this year my best yet. My goal next year is to aim for a 100% hard mode completion. With 2 weeks to go I have completed 297 books that qualify for bingo granted there are a few re-reads in there and MANY books by the same author as I went deep down the rabbit whole in series and related works this year.

Random thoughts on this years bingo - 

* Least enjoyable - Romance - Witchmark by C.L. Polk.
* Most Anticipated Read - Rhythm of War by Brandon Sanderson
* Hardest Square - Self Published hard - [Weapons of Disharmony](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54780895-weapons-of-disharmony) by Chad Retterrath (still only 13 ratings for anyone still looking for a hard mode book)
* Biggest surprise - Cradle by Will Wight. Just discovered this series this year and easily some of my favorite books this year after just finishing book 6 yesterday
* First year using ZERO re-reads for a square even though we are allowed one (yes I know it is blasphemy that I just read The Martian and Dune both for the first time this year)

519,Fantasy,A Literary Review of 'Blackwing' by Ed McDonald,"Spoilers Below! You've been warned. Also, all reviews are subjective. My opinions are my own.

This book has a very strong Grimdark tone. The author did a wonderful job of giving this book a dark and gritty sensation, a making this book's genre a combination of Fantasy, Dystopia, Noir Mystery and Weird Western. I listened to the audiobook, and the narrator did an A+ job. I got ([‘Malazan: Deadhouse Gates’](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2018/02/16/malazan-deadhouse-gates-book-review/)), ([‘The Lies of Locke Lamora’](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2017/02/17/climbing-mount-readmore-2017-16100-the-lies-of-locke-lamora/)) and ([‘The Gunslinger’](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2017/10/26/the-gunslinger-book-review/)) vibes off of this one. Let's get into this. 

**READER'S EMOTIONAL RESPONSE**

Reading this book, I was deeply invested into the setting, story and characters thanks to the author's strong authorial voice. This was not a fun or happy book, but was a compelling one for it's moody tone. The second half of the author's book had my suspension of disbelief completely engaged. The first half was less engaging, but still readable. Overall, this book was captivating.

Overall, I give the story's Emotional Resonance: (B+)

**CONCEPT AND EXECUTION**

The book's concept was twofold. 

The first half of the book was a mystery story in the noir style in a Weird Western setting. The protagonist (an alcoholic detective/cowboy sheriff) has to go into the weird wilds to track down and kill criminals, solve crimes, mourn his Lost Lenore, and try to save a new love interest who's the target of assassinations. The second half of the book is a desperate preparation and defense against the attacking eldritch enemy army, despite traitor and infiltrating spies. 

I think this was a good concept, and it was well executed. The author played with the tropes of the Weird Western and Noir very well, to create a fantastical story. I especially loved the ending. 

My biggest problem with this book's execution was the author sometimes needed to show, not tell plot events more often.

Overall, I give the story's Concept and Execution a rating of: (B)

**CHARACTERS AND CHARACTERIZATION:**

The protagonist Galharrow was a by-the-books alcoholic Noir detective hybridized with a Grimdark warrior protagonist. He is well written- but you have to be in the mood for the whole 'alcoholic Noir detective' schnitck. But if you are not in the mood for the 'alcoholic Noir detective/sword guy' thing, you might not enjoy this one as much. I liked his character growth, going from being a hardened warrior, to letting himself feel love again. I've read it before, but it was done well.

This is a 1st person novel, so the authorial voice of the novel had Galharrow's gritty, pessimistic attitude- which is great! I enjoyed the protagonist and his retelling of this story. 

Galharrow's love interest Lezabeth (Elizabeth? Lizabet? I don't know, I listened to the audiobook) needed a little bit more work. She was 66% of the way to being an excellent character, but she just needed a little bit more texture to make her amazing. As is, she was a bit too much of a Noir 'sacrificial maiden/Lost Lenore' cliche.

The side characters were fun, and some of them were real characters. None were boring or trite or cliche. The author embraced his sarcastic/ironic/grimdark voice and gave everyone attitude. But to quote Syndrome, ""When everyone's special, no one is."" Because so many characters embraced the grimdark attitude, it meant less when the protagonist embraced it. In short, I wanted a wider range of personalities from the side characters.

I will say I liked the creepy Frankenstien wizard. Very spooky. 

Overall, I give the story's Characterization a rating of: (C+) 

**PACING AND STRUCTURE**

I'll come right out and say it: I occasionally got bored in the first half of the book. Up until the point that the Crow first made his will known and started speaking with the protagonist, I was not too invested in the plot. After the protagonist got his assignment from the Crow the pacing gained a certain intensity, but even then it was not intense *enough* for me to call it fast paced. The book only became fast paced in the last 1/3 of the book.

'Fast paced' doesn't necessarily mean 'well paced.' However I think this book needed to have a faster paced beginning of the story.

I'm going to examine this book's structure. I believe this book most closely follows the [5 act format.](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2020/07/20/on-pacing-and-structure-part-4-five-act-format/)

1. **The Status Quo**
   1. As I said above, the status quo is Galharrow's miserable existence taking bounties in the wastes. It's clear to the reader that Galharrow is looking to die out in the wastes, even if Galharrow doesn't realize it himself.
   2. Same flaw as I mentioned above. Act 1 should have some thematic resonance with the resolution of the story.
2. **Challenge to the Status Quo**
   1. In structures, acts begin and end when the protagonist makes a choice which cannot be unmade.
   2. The inciting incident which sets off act 2 is the Crow giving Galharrow his orders to protect Lizabeth. Galharrow accepting that assignment is the choice which causes the transion between act 1 and 2. He finds Lizabeth, realizes she's crazy, but decides to help her anyway even though she's crazy. That second decision is what ends the act.
3. **The Turning Point/ The Road of Trials**
   1. This act contained a lot of 'faffing around doing stuff.' The protagonist fought monsters, spoke with corrupt politicians, interviewed engineers, all with the goal of helping Lizabeth. 
   2. This act is called 'The Road of Trials' for a reason. This act can contain a lot of different problems which need to be solved, the solving of which propels the story towards it's conclusion.
   3. In the middle of this act is the Midpoint Climax. In this book, the Midpoint Climax was a great big fight scene, where the protagonist and his love interest fight monsters. I liked this fight, because it mirrored the final battle in several important ways.
4. **Escalation of the Challenge**
   1. Lizabeth is taken captive, and Galharrow has to spring her from jail/the mental institution.
   2. The purpose of this act from a formula perspective is to set the pieces in motion for the conclusion. In the process of freeing Lizabeth, we get valuable information about who the traitor is, learn more about the monster's endgame plan, and gain a shred of hope of defeating the enemy army.
5. **Climax and Conclusion**
   1. A big fight scene.
   2. The denouement was a bit of a letdown for me.

What to make of this book's structure? It was a bit messy, at least compared to the 'ideal' of the 5 act structure. And that's okay! The rules of structure are more like guidelines. But I must confess that I think that Acts 3 and 4 were a little bloated. This book had a lot of 'plot points for the sake of plot points.' I felt like a good number of the events in the story could have been trimmed out to make a leaner whole.

So structure and pacing wise, I think the author did a passing job of things. Like an old jalopy which will get you there in the end, the structure and pacing of this story weren't it's finest features but nonetheless didn't buckle under the strain either.

Overall, I give the story's Pacing and Structure: (C)

**PLOT, STAKES** **AND TENSION**

This book's plot was way too complex, involving too much wandering around. The whole 'defend a city which is too corrupt to be defended' thing was well done, but at times the plot felt listless. I enjoyed the book's well-realized gritty atmosphere, and that carried the plot for me. (But this complaint is very much a personal taste sort of thing.)

The book's stakes were well integrated into the storytelling. They were high stakes (fate of a city/fate of a continent), but also personal stakes (the protagonist lives in the city/the life of his hopeful girlfriend is on the line). I found the stakes compelling.

The book's tension was good. From the moment the main plot was introduced (the protagonist being sent to bodyguard his old flame), you could feel that the narrative was under strain and constantly under pressure. The protagonist's goal was to help her and protect her, and the enemy's goal was to capture or kill her at all points of the story. These simple goals are a sign of good tension.

Overall, I give the story's Plot: (B-)

**EVERYTHING ELSE (SETTING, WORLDBUILDING, TONE, PROSE AND THEME)**

For me, the setting and worldbuilding were the best parts of this story. I liked the doomed world this story portrayed, clearly on it's last legs after an apocalyptic war between two immense wizarding powers. Human civilization is used as pawns by both sides. While it's clear that the enemies were REALLY bad folks, it was also clear that the friendly wizards were frenemies at best.

I don't often say this, but I liked the magic system as described in this book. The characters can weave moonlight and store it in batteries to perform their spells. In this story, we see magic mainly used as a combat tool. This light-based magic is opposed to the enemy's gross biological magic, which sinks worms into your brain and mutates your body into serving them. I especially liked how the monsters had innocuous names like 'Darlings.' It made them all the more menacing.

This book is a masterclass on tone storytelling. The authorial voice was gargling whiskey and smoking a pack a day for the last twenty years. Read only a few pages of this story and you get the feeling that '*this world is ruined and no one's happy.'* The story is told from the first person perspective, so the 'ruination' the tone comes across does double duty of characterizing the protagonist. 

Was the tone subtle? No. But the author wasn't trying for subtle. The author clearly wanted to drown the reader in the despair of the world. He succeed. As this is a debut, I was impressed.

The prose was good. At moments it was quite elegant and beautiful. At other moments it was gross and gritty. I liked this dialectic of quality- the grime made the beauty work all the more. However I could tell this was a debut novel. Sometimes the angsty prose was too tryhard, and occasionally the pretty prose was purple. The author's voice was very enjoyable, but needed some refinement.

I don't think the author wrote this book with a theme in mind. The closest thing to a theme I can pick out of this one is 'losing what you love,' but that's more of a genre motif for Grimdark so I don't think that counts. The very ending of the book had a theme of 'sacrifice what you love in order to win' theme, but that theme wasn't really carried on throughout the rest of the book. 

I don't demand authors write their books with blunt moralizing in mind (quite the opposite, really). However a solid theme can really join together all the plot arcs in a holistic and memorable fashion. If you've read the Grimdark book '[The Dragon Republic'](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2020/10/01/a-review-of-the-dragon-republic-by-r-f-kuang-book-2-in-the-poppy-war-series/) by R. F. Kuang, part of the reason why that book is so good is because it has the themes of 'toxic relationships' integrated into every aspect of the plot and characters. The theme drives home the fact that if those people got some therapy that world's problems needn't always escalate to outright war. As 'Blackwing' is a debut novel, I'm willing to forgive the author.

I give Everything Else: (B+) 

**AUDIOBOOK NOTES**

The audiobook version of this was excellent. The narrator and the authorial voice were well matched together, with one complementing the other. My final grade of this book will be improved based upon the high quality of the narration.

I give the Audiobook: (A+)

**Lessons Learned**

I'm an aspiring author, and I believe that I should learn new things from every book I read. Here are some lessons I learned from this book, and I'll try to incorporate into my own works.

* Don't be afraid to let your tone shine through the authorial voice. The author had a tone he wanted to write, and he tripled down on it. It made the book memorable, and that's good.
* I liked the worldbuilding, specifically the terrifying mundanity of some of the monsters. The concept of the Darlings was super creepy.
* I liked the balance of the prose, where the author was willing to be both grim and beautiful. The grimness made the beauty seem all the more beautiful, and the beauty made the grimness seem more real.

**SUMMARY**

This book is good. For me at least, this book never rose to the level of absolute excellence. However the author clearly had a vision for what he wanted to write and he did an admirable job of achieving that goal. Were there flaws? Yes. It was a bit rough around the edges prose-wise, and the pacing got a bit listless in the beginning and the middle. However those problems were small, and I was nonetheless impressed that this was the author's debut. McDonald's got chops. 

Should you read it? If my review sounds interesting, then yes. I'm not a huge fan of Grimdark, but this story does a good job of melding Weird West with Grimdark with Noir. If that sounds up your alley, check this out.

I listened to the audiobook, and can attest that the narrator Colin Mace knocked this one out of the park.

**STARS: 3.3 OUT OF 5 STARS (5 Stars=Perfect, 4 Stars=Great, 3 Stars=Good, 2 Stars=Fun but Flawed, 1 Star=Not Recommended)**

**JUDGEMENT: Very solid debut.**

520,Fantasy,"Where Shadows Lie by Allegra Pescatore: Tropes used - Dragon/Dragon gods, Rebellion, Tyrant King, Forbidden Magic"," 

I knew right away this was going to be a book I was going to enjoy. The prologue was brief but also written in a way that made an impact. I felt for the characters within a few pages which isn’t easy to do. For bonus points, the consequences of the prologue were immediately relevant to the story – it irks me when it takes forever for the prologue to become relevant.

The king in this story is an asshole, he’s a tyrant of the worst kind. He doesn’t care who he kills as long as it benefits him in the end, and it doesn’t matter if he desecrates their bodies post-mortem either. Their culture believes that to bury a body is to bury the soul and it’s an extreme violation of their religion. It’s typically a punishment reserved for only the most heinous of criminals…. but the King will bury whole villages of innocent people – men, women and children.

This king had a son who died trying to assassinate him, and the sister, Elenor, is then captured by the rebellion. Elenor knows all of the people who were in the rebellion and her heart is crushed because she feels betrayed by friends she considered as close as family. She’s extremely reluctant to believe that her father would be capable of the atrocities her friends are just now telling her about, and she keeps trying to escape despite the rebellions good intentions for her. They want her parents dead and to put her on the throne… and she’s fighting it the entire time.

There is a pretty broad cast of characters, I liked most of the side characters and for the most part they felt well fleshed out. I would say without a doubt though that Elenor is the main character and everyone else is just in her orbit. Elenor is a little haughty, but also brave and snarky. She’s struggled through a lifetime of pain, her legs don’t always work correctly and at times the pain is so bad it’s made her wish her her own death. She’s a young woman so she’s not as experienced and as worldly as some of the other characters, but she can learn quickly. She’s also fucking infuriating because the reader knows that the rebels are the good guys in this story, and she keeps trying to work against them and thwarts them in ways that lead to tragic results. But, you can also totally sympathize with her. Most people wouldn’t just stand by and let people kill their parents, even if they were terrible people. It makes for a really compelling tension between characters and brings about questions of morality and whatnot. These are the kinds of stories I love.

Daemon is a mysterious character, and he’s also deadly. He’s probably over 500 years old, but no one knows how he makes himself live that long. He has made himself a little island and tries to keep out of the way of politics but doesn’t hesitate to kill people, either.

There are a handful of other characters with varying degrees of page time, as well as some interlude chapters that take a while to connect to main story. For the most part I felt like they were well fleshed out, the ones that didn’t get a lot of page time, like North, were hard to get to know since they are featured briefly and only every once in a while… but over time with enough chapters I got to know them better. That said, for as many characters as there were, the story didn’t become unfocused or meandering in the way that happens sometimes with large casts. A surprising amount of side characters died over the course of the book, packing punches the whole way through.

The world building is expansive and most of it was delivered naturally without info dumps or awkward dialogue. It’s difficult to do that and I always admire a slow reveal of a huge world that’s clearly well thought out. I also really enjoy the politics and backstabbing and high stakes.

One of the things I didn’t totally care for was the romance between a couple of the characters. I’m not really one for sex scenes… they just don’t do much for me… I tend to skip over them when I’m reading but since I was using audible I didn’t really have that option. Obviously this is a personal taste thing, so your mileage may vary.

The writing was great, it got out of the way of the story, it didn’t meander and get overly descriptive, the dialogue sounded natural and unforced, making it feel polished and well edited. This also has a lot of real world cursing and didn’t have much in the way of in-world fake cursing, just my kind of book.

The pacing could be slow at times. Elenor took a long time to gather evidence and weigh it and make a decision she felt was right for herself, her family, and her people – but it took a long time to get there. It did give it a realistic feel to it, and it gave Elenor a chance to explore her own morality and sense of justice and honor which was neat to see. I did feel like it dragged a bit between 60-80%, there were some setting changes for certain characters and whole new aspects of the world opened up. On one hand this was neat, on the other it slowed me down because it was starting over with a new culture and society.

This was an engaging read that I will be recommending to a broad audience. I feel like it has something for everyone while avoiding a lot of pet peeves (at least mine, anyway). I’ll definitely be picking up more by this author. The narrator was new to me, and I’ll definitely be looking for more books she’s performed, she did a great job.

528,Fantasy,Beyond the Black River - by Robert E. Howard,"After a long break I decided to continue with my collection of Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories, arranged in in-universe chronological order.

This outing is Beyond the Black River, where Conan is fighting as a mercenary for Aquilonia, the realm he eventually becomes king of. Its distant, out-of-touch leaders are attempting to expand into a wild jungle frontier, and the local tribes of Pictish barbarians are having none of it. A wizard is in the process of uniting the tribes and preparing to smash them into the frontier fort that protects the Aquilonian settlers.

Most of the story is told through the eyes of Balthus, a tough woodsman and mercenary who encounters Conan and inevitably finds himself paling in comparison with the ultimate power fantasy character. I find that I always have somewhat mixed feelings on that aspect of Howard's stories: The man had a strong belief in barbarism being the natural and superior state of being for mankind, and I wouldn't mind the outlook at all if the narration didn't go on and on about it in each story. To Howard's credit, though, he *doesn't* go the route of making all the civilized characters weak and cowardly, and Balthus himself is an excellent example of this.

As for the rest of the story, it is probably the most in-your-face with the whole ""civilization is temporary"" thing Howard had going on, as Conan and Balthus go into the jungle to battle the Picts. And what always draws me back to these stories is that raw, shamelessly brutal atmosphere Howard captures like no one else. The Hyborian Age is a merciless place, but somehow it also doesn't feel like edgy grimdark. It just is what it is. Howard also delivers a feeling of ancientness and dark magic and bygone gods that is arguably superior to HP Lovecraft himself, and once again I find myself wishing that Robert E. Howard had lived longer than a measly 30 years.

Overall, this is a fun, brutal short story, and if you haven't given the original Conan stories a look I recommend doing so."

533,Fantasy,What to read,"I had been struggling with fantasy for a while now. I read YA fantasy for the most part, but for a year or so I didn't enjoy almost anything I have read. So I tried adult fantasy, I have read Mistborn and loved it, and I am currently reading Wheel of Time. But my problem with adult fantasy is that most of the popular series have male main characters who are sexist, and women are just not well written. I have tried reading Robin Hobb but it is too character driven for me. 

I have spent hours on this site trying to find something that sounds interesting but I can't so I am asking for help.

What I want is a epic fantasy book series with good writing please, that has multiple pov and that some of them are women, who are strong and well written. Also interesting magic sistem and good worldbuilding. I love chosen one trope, and charaters with actual magical abilities.

I have read Winternight trilogy, tried Naomi Novik didn't like it, and The Way of Kings is on my reading list, I didn't like Warbreaker."

While I admit the world building seems decent so far (I'm only about 45 chapters in) the magic system is interesting and characters are interesting, so it only feels so much more annoying when the narrative has to suck MC's schlong on every single page, it takes away from reading experience and feels forced and shallow when every character and their nanny ""feel jealous and have a bout of rage that they have to suppress in their hearts as mc walks away with cold eyes"". There's way too many instances as this loaded into each and every chapter and while it isn't a deal breaker, I wonder if it is worth continuing. So please tell me if any of this changes in later arcs or if it is worth continuing considering the shitty writing so far."

Anyway, here it is:

|SQUARE|BOOK|NOTE|

I still think it would fit for the Bingo, but I don't want to risk it. Anyway, I've been meaning to read **The Three-Body Problem** trilogy for years and I finally understand what the rave reviews are all about. The writing (or perhaps the translation) doesn't really sparkle, and the 3rd book felt like it suffered from some sexist gender essentialist bullshit but the science discussed in all 3 books is simply brilliant. It felt like Mr Liu broke my mind over and over again, in the best way possible. I wrote longer reviews of the 1st book [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/11/13/the-holy-war-for-the-soul-of-science-a-review-of-liu-cixins-the-three-body-problem/), and the 2nd book [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/12/06/humanitys-fight-or-flight-response-a-review-of-liu-cixins-the-dark-forest/). Could I have used graphic novels in this square? Because I also read a bunch of **Demon Slayer** and **The Promised Neverland** mangas recently.|
|**Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold** ^((HARD MODE: The entire book takes place in this setting))|**Frankenstein** by Mary Shelley ^((EASY MODE))|I did re-read Le Guin's **The Left Hand of Darkness** this year for my local book club but since I don't want to use re-reads, I picked **Frankenstein**. Can it be argued that the whole book actually takes place in the North Pole since everything else are just stories within stories? Haha, anyway, the book absolutely belongs in the pantheon of SF greats, as relevant and thought-provoking today as it was back then. I did come out of it being less sympathetic to Frankenstein's creature than most people, since he is basically an incel. My full review can be found [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/06/18/frankensteins-creature-is-an-incel-a-review-of-mary-shelleys-frankenstein/).|
|**Optimistic SFF** ^((HARD MODE: Not Becky Chambers))|**A Song for a New Day** by Sarah Pinsker ^((HARD MODE))|I read this one because I was [a guest on a local book podcast](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/07/15/2020-nebula-awards-my-guest-appearance-on-the-two-book-nerds-talking-podcast/) covering the nominees for the Nebula Awards last year, and spoiler alert, **A Song for a New Day** won for Best Novel. I guess I am of two minds about it: on one hand, it is incredibly timely. It was published a couple of months before the world learns of the existence COVID-19 and the way it described a society being overwhelmed by a pandemic and thus, was forced to stay in a dystopian state of perpetual quarantine was spot on. It also described how jobs have to be done remotely, how big corps like Amazon and streaming entertainment services grows fatter than ever, and how the performing arts became soulless and commercialised since they are now filtered, sanitised and packaged by those aforementioned streaming services. At the same time, it also feels like the ""good guys"" in the novel who push against regulations to assemble for live music performances feel like bratty anti-maskers and COVID deniers.

|**Novel Featuring Necromancy** ^((HARD MODE: Necromancer is the protagonist))|**A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians** by H.G. Parry ^((HARD MODE))|The synopsis of **A Declaration of the Rights of Magicians** contains this combination of words: *""the necromancer  Robespierre""*. I was immediately sold. Robespierre is one of the three protagonists of the book alongside Pitt the Younger and Toussaint L'Ouverture and it covers the period surrounding the French and Haitian Revolution—but y'know, with magic. I reviewed the book [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/07/03/a-tale-of-two-cities-and-an-island-a-review-of-h-g-parrys-a-declaration-of-the-rights-of-magicians/).|
|**Ace / Aro Spec Fic** ^((HARD MODE: Ace / Aro protagonist))|**Best Served Cold** by Joe Abercrombie ^((EASY MODE))|Joe Abercrombie needs no introduction in this sub. The Aro/Ace characters I am referring to is of course one of the members of Monza Murcatto's crew of seven, the neurodivergent Friendly. He specifically described his disinterest in romance or sex in the book. My full review of *Best Served Cold* can be found [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/12/14/murcattos-seven-and-her-grand-tour-of-revenge-and-mayhem-a-review-of-joe-abercrombies-best-served-cold/). I had wanted to use Jo Walton's **Lifelode** for this square, but I already used a book of hers for another square. And Jo Walton actually has the **Tir Tanagiri** books which features an Ace/Aro protagonist and would qualify for hard mode, but I read them before the 2020 Bingo challenge started.|
|**Novel Featuring a Ghost** ^((HARD MODE: At least one main protagonist is a ghost))|**A Stranger in Olondria** by Sofia Samatar ^((HARD MODE))|**A Stranger in Olondria** follows the story of Jevick and the ghost girl who haunts him. It is a book which meditates on the meanings of books, the reading and writing thereof, and how the act of telling one's story can change the world. I much prefer the chapters featuring the ghost girl. Warning: it may make you weep. My long-form review can be found [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/09/25/the-haunting-of-jevick-of-tyom-a-review-of-sofia-samatars-a-stranger-in-olondria/).|
|**Novel Featuring Exploration** ^((HARD MODE: The exploration is the central plot))|**Piranesi** by Susanna Clarke ^((HARD MODE))|Susanna Clarke is my favourite author and while it is wee bit disappointing that her first book in 14 years isn't a sequel to **Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell**, I really enjoyed **Piranesi** which does pick up on many of the same themes and imagery she played with in the past, including the exploration of beautiful, crumbling and lonely labyrinthine ruins, and the that humanity is minuscule compared to the wilder and older forces of the natural world. The story mainly follows the titular character as he roams the infinite House, making observations and writing notes about it, and his Crusoe-esque survival routines. I have a lot more to say about this book [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/08/24/welcome-to-the-great-indoors-a-review-of-susanna-clarkes-piranesi/) in my review.|
|**Climate Fiction** ^((HARD MODE: Not post-apocalyptic))|**Oryx and Crake** by Margaret Atwood ^((EASY MODE))|Atwood is one of those authors who can't write a bad book, in my opinion, but apparently she can write a book that can use a stricter hand during the editing stage. It's a post-apocalyptic novel featuring a world overridden by diseases, runaway transgenic experiments, and the effects of climate change—interspersed with flashbacks to the before-times. In spite of Atwood's protests, I absolutely consider this book to be sci-fi. I had initially wanted to use **The Three-Body Problem** for this square because that book would qualify for hard mode, but I needed a translated SF work as well (and didn't know if translated manga counts).|
|**Novel with a Colour in the Title** ^((HARD MODE: Not black, red, grey, or white))|**The King in Yellow** by Robert W. Chambers ^((HARD MODE))|Four stories are loosely connected by an eldritch and malevolent entity known as the **King in Yellow** (and a play with the same title). H.P. Lovecraft have cited Chambers' work to be an inspiration for his own stories. Chambers' writing, while antiquated (and perhaps because of it), is very effective in evoking a sense of dread. I actually first learned about **The King in Yellow** from season 1 of True Detective.|
|**Any** r/fantasy **Book Club Book of the Month OR** r/fantasy **Read-along Book** ^((HARD MODE: Must read a current selection of either a book club or read-along and participate in the discussion))|**Peace Talks** by Jim Butcher ^((EASY MODE)), **Battle Ground** by Jim Butcher ^((EASY MODE))|The read-along was still active when I read these, but it has wound down now, but alas, I didn't manage to participate in the discussions. I thought **Peace Talks** is a discouraging relapse by Jim Butcher into his old male gazey days while the plot defers all resolutions to the next book. **Battle Ground** has many awesome moments and I like that received almost no instances of sexual objectification in it, but it felt like it was padded with too many fights I don't care about. It could have been 1 book, in my opinion. My reviews of the 2 book can be found [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/the-long-awaited-return-of-harry-dresden-a-review-of-jim-butchers-peace-talks/) and [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/10/23/chicago-total-war-a-review-of-jim-butchers-battle-ground/).|
|**Self-Published SFF Novel** ^((HARD MODE: Self-pubbed and has fewer than 50 ratings on goodreads))|**The Sword of Kaigen** by M.L. Wang ^((EASY MODE))|This is an amazing standalone self-published work that puts many traditionally published fantasy novels to shame. Is there a reason why it isn't picked up by a publishing house yet? Now, it's not perfect, but I love world-building which features a reverse historical racial hierarchy (white people being considered underprivileged compared to black and brown people; instead of Japan subjugating Korea and committing atrocities in China, fantasy Japan is a vassal state of fantasy Korea and fantasy China invades Japan and commit atrocities there instead). Also, like **Avatar: the Last Airbender**, there are lineages which have control over certain elements, and the depth by which Ms Wang explores the water/ice powers of the people of Shirojima felt very satisfying. I love how the author discuss the themes of motherhood, duty, and identity from a very Asian perspective. However, I am not a fan of the density of made up fantasy words (forcing me to consult the glossary very often) and the references to other **Theonite** book plots. I mean, I wouldn't mind it so much if the book didn't end on a chapter that is mainly inserted to set up other books, instead of a stronger ending resting on this standalone book's story.|
|**Novel with Chapter Epigraphs** ^((HARD MODE: Original to the novel i.e., not a quotation from another source))|**The Once and Future Witches** by Alix E. Harrow ^((HARD MODE))|It's one of my favourite books last year. After reading **The Ten Thousand Doors of January**, Alix E. Harrow became an automatic pre-order author for me. I'll buy anything she sells. I don't know if she was the first one to do it, but the marriage of witches with the suffrage movement is such a simple and brilliant concept that I wish I thought of it first. The working of magic in this world Ms Harrow envisioned requires three components: the will, the words, and the way. The words are represented by children’s rhymes and proverbial sayings by old wives that adorns the start of each chapter in the form of charming epigraphs—all familiar, with subtle alterations and additions original to the novel. Anyway, if you want to hear me gush about this book more, you can read my review [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/11/02/suffragists-but-witches-a-review-of-alix-e-harrows-the-once-and-future-witches/).|
|**Novel Published in 2020** ^((HARD MODE: It's also a Debut Novel))|**The Order of the Pure Moon Reflected in Water** by Zen Cho ^((EASY MODE))|It's a fun novella by a Hugo-winning author from my country. I mainly love it because of HOW unapologetically Malaysian it is, from the way the characters talk to multiple untranslated Malaysian words used in the book. If anyone is interested in an explanation of some of the cultural and historical references featured in the story, check out my review of it [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/09/07/once-upon-a-time-in-a-malaysian-coffeehouse-a-review-of-zen-chos-the-order-of-the-pure-moon-reflected-in-water/).|
|**Novel Set in a School or University** ^((HARD MODE: Not Harry Potter or the Magicians))|**A Deadly Education** by Naomi Novik ^((HARD MODE))|[My review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/j8o7om/so_naomi_noviks_a_deadly_education_is_accused_of/) defending this book from accusations of racism from my perspective as a person-of-colour is probably my most intense post in r/fantasy and it ultimately had to be locked. Anyway, I think it is a cool departure from Novik's usual tone. It's pretty YA, but I absolutely adore the concept of a prophesised Dark Lord trying her hardest to avoid fulfilling the prophecy, even though everything (including the school) conspires to push her towards her destiny. I also love the himbo romantic interest and can't wait for book 2.|
|**Book About Books** ^((HARD MODE: Does not feature a library, public, school, or private))|**Or What You Will** by Jo Walton ^((HARD MODE))|Jo Walton is another one of my favourite authors and it is a surprise every time she pushes a new book out, because she really pushes the envelope on what fantasy can be. **Or What You Will** is about  a protean nameless character living in the mind of an aging, award-winning author named Sylvia Harrison. He (always male), had  embodied many characters she wrote over her 40-year career, but he  remained a figment of her imagination. And when she dies, he would too, but he has a plan to save her. As I wrote in [my review](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/07/07/a-review-of-jo-waltons-or-what-you-will/), *""I sprained my brain thinking about how Ms Walton wrote herself into a  fictional writer writing herself into fiction. There are parts of the book that are being written as you are reading it. There is a chapter  entitled Deus ex Machina. It’s pretty wild.""* It is incredibly meta.|
|**A Book that Made You Laugh** ^((HARD MODE: Not Pratchett))|**Harrow the Ninth** by Tamsyn Muir ^((HARD MODE))|**Harrow the Ninth**, is the sequel to 2019's breakout hit **Gideon the Ninth**, and it was one of the most audacious books I have ever read in my life. While I didn't care much for the 1st book's story, I love Ms Muir's sense of humour A LOT. I am happy to say that book 2 is an improvement in every way. Love the 2nd person narration and why it was so. Love the multiple fanfic AUs the author wrote for her own story within her own novel. Love all the memes. Fuller review [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/08/16/yer-a-necromancer-harry-a-review-of-tamsyn-muirs-harrow-the-ninth/). I had initially planned this to fill the necromancer square but I honestly want to highlight how hard this book made me laugh.|
|**Five SFF Short Stories** ^((HARD MODE: Read an entire SFF anthology or collection))|**The Birthday of the World and Other Stories** by Ursula K. Le Guin ^((HARD MODE)), **Exhalations: Stories** by Ted Chiang ^((HARD MODE))|**The Birthday of the World** is comprised of many shorts set in Le Guin's Hainish universe but my absolute favourite of the collection is **Paradises Lost** (which is not a Hainish story). I liked it so much I wrote [a review](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/06/26/a-space-novella-about-the-immigrant-experience-the-chinese-diaspora-faith-a-review-of-ursula-k-leguins-paradises-lost/) just for it. The story is about the in-between generations of a generational ship: the ones whose entire world is the ship because they never knew the planet their ancestors left behind, and will not see the planet their descendants will colonise. Ted Chiang's **Exhalations** continues in Le Guin's tradition of writing very humanistic sci-fi stories and I love almost every story in this new collection of his. I highly recommend it.|
|**Big Dumb Object** ^((HARD MODE: The classic golden-age of science fiction definition of Big Dumb Object - Dyson Spheres, alien spaceships, a BIG thing that appears with no explanation))|**The Book of M** by Peng Shepherd ^((EASY MODE))|The Big Dumb Object in **The Book of M** is a mysterious illness in which people started to mysteriously lose their shadows, and their memories would fade shortly after. And what people forget can affect reality. Things people forget may disappear, and new bizarre things might come into existence due to people misremembering things. It has an absolutely devastating ending. It's worth reading the book just for it. You can find my review [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/08/09/mad-max-ory-road-a-review-of-peng-shepherds-the-book-of-m/).|
|**Feminist Novel** ^((HARD MODE: Feminist novel by a person of colour or Indigeous author))|**The City We Became** by N.K. Jemisin ^((HARD MODE))|This book covered practically every feminist theme and then some, but I love how Ms Jemisin wrote a Lovecraft story that specifically interrogates Lovecraft's legacy (particularly since he was known as a deeply racist and xenophobic person, even by the standards of his time). I know the fantasy community have a complicated history with Lovecraft but I found that Jemisin provided the most satisfactorily response to this issue to date (for me), and she neither forgives Lovecraft nor does she want us to forget him. It's also a bonus that practically none of the main characters are straight or white. I wrote a review of the book [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/10/01/an-urban-fantasy-literally-a-review-of-n-k-jemisins-the-city-we-became/).|
|**Novel by a Canadian Author** ^((HARD MODE: Book from an Canadian small press OR self-published Canadian author))|**Under Heaven** by Guy Gavriel Kay ^((EASY MODE))|The historical period covered in **Under Heaven** is one that is familiar to me since as a Chinese person, I grew up with a lot of Hong Kong TV shows and movies about Yang Guifei and An Lushan's rebellion. While I applaud at the amount of research Mr Kay did to achieve a novel that feels very authentic to me, I also wondered at some of the story choices he made. I share my thoughts on them [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/08/04/250-galloping-mcguffins-a-review-of-guy-gavriel-kays-under-heaven/) in this review.|
|**Novel with a Number in the Title** ^((HARD MODE: Also features a colour in the title))|**Four Roads Cross** by Max Gladstone ^((EASY MODE)), **Full Fathom Five** by Max Gladtone ^((EASY MODE))|I originally had **Nineteen Eighty-Four** in this square but I realise I can get hard mode for the politics square if I move it there. Anyway, I love the entire **Craft Sequence** by Max Gladstone and I am glad I waited to read the whole series last year (just in time for this Bingo since ALL 5 of the origina books in the series have numbers in the title). His work feels like a mix between Terry Pratchett and China Miéville, and I love the world-building. Imagine a world controlled by lawyer-sorcerers arguing over the terms of reality, souls is currency, gods which function as corporations, and chapter 11 bankruptcies are acts of necromancy. I reviewed **Four Roads Cross** [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/04/05/the-perils-of-corporate-godhood-a-review-of-max-gladstones-four-roads-cross/) and **Full Fathom Five** [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/05/27/offshore-shell-religions-and-idolatry-on-fantasy-hawaii-a-review-of-max-gladstones-full-fathom-five/). But I recommend that you start from **Three Parts Dead**, which I reviewed [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/06/13/black-lives-matter-and-us-foreign-policy-a-review-of-max-gladstones-last-first-snow/). I didn't review **Two Serpents Rise**, but I did pen [one](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/06/13/black-lives-matter-and-us-foreign-policy-a-review-of-max-gladstones-last-first-snow/) for **Last First Snow**.|
|**Romantic Fantasy / Paranormal Romance** ^((HARD MODE: Read and participate in HEA Book Club pick))|**Silver in the Woods** by Emily Tesh ^((EASY MODE)), **Drowned Country** by Emily Tesh ^((EASY MODE))|I didn't participate in the HEA Book Club pick but the **Greenhollow Duology** by Emily Tesh is possibly my favourite read of 2020. The central romance plot of **Greenhollow** is between Henry Silver and an enigmatic being known as The Green Man. I love everything about this: the world-building, the characters, the frankly lovely relationship between Henry and Tobias, the prose... it is frankly just a stellar work of fantasy, romance or not. You can hear me gush more about these books [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/10/03/somethings-waiting-in-the-bushes-of-love-a-review-of-emily-teshs-greenhollow-duology/).|
|**Novel with a Magical Pet** ^((HARD MODE: Magical pet can also speak))|**The Girl and the Ghost** by Hanna Alkaf ^((HARD MODE))|It's a lovely middle-grade dark fantasy about a sensitive and intelligent Matilda-esque girl named Suraya and a pet ghost she accidentally inherited when her estranged grandmother died. This book is specifically about a cultural belief in my country about saka or hereditary spirits, often blamed for causing mental illness. The ghost (named Pink) which Suraya inherited is a pelesit, which appears in the shape of a grasshopper and is passed down through the female line (as opposed to a bajang, which takes the shape of a civet and is patrilineal). My review of this book can be found [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/07/25/the-haunted-life-of-a-malaysian-schoolgirl-a-review-of-hanna-alkafs-the-girl-and-the-ghost/), along with the picture of the creature drawn by the author herself in a special ARC copy I received.|
|**Format: Graphic Novel** **(at least 1 vol.) OR Audiobook / Audio drama** ^((HARD MODE: Graphic Novel - stand alone graphic novel. Audiobook / audio drama - has to be over 25 hours long))|**Fangs** by Sarah Andersen ^((HARD MODE))|Last year, Sarah Andersen (of Sarah's Scribbles fame) published a sweet standalone graphic novel about a romantic relationship between a vampire and a werewolf called **Fangs**. It is a gorgeously drawn in a way that is different from the more cartoony style Ms Andersen is known for, and it is a slice-of-life graphic novel about the quirks and challenges of the dating life of these two supernatural beings.|
|**Novel Featuring Politics** ^((HARD MODE: Not featuring royalty))|**Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell** ^((HARD MODE))|This is my sole re-read for this Bingo but I did do it in a new format: an audiobook. It remains the scariest dystopian novel I've ever read and Simon Prebble's narration is absolutely top notch. He was genuinely terrifying when he laid out the Party's purpose and ethos near the end of the book, in a gleeful rasp that chills the bones. I reviewed the audiobook [here](https://nusantaranaga.wordpress.com/2020/04/09/revisiting-oceania-in-an-aural-format-a-review-of-george-orwells-nineteen-eighty-four/) in which I also gave some small critiques to Orwell's original story.|

So the ultimate tally is 11 easy squares, 2 hard squares, and 12 hero squares (or 14 hero squares if we count the short reviews I gave here for the works I didn't review on my own blog). It was fun planning what to read for the squares though I ended up moving many around in order to fulfill more hard mode criteria. I realise now that I could have used the 13 volumes of *The Promised Neverland* manga I read for the Translated Novel square and move *The Three-Body Problem* to the Climate Fiction square where I can score one additional hero mode win. Oh well.

This had been a great fun. Looking forward to the next Bingo!"

I know I’m about to get so much hate for a post like this... but Jesus...

He started a whole giant fantasy series about a whole land, and gave a map of it... and the whole story takes place in .001% of the map? 

There’s a character that everyone says is so clever but she’s an insufferable bitch?

The entire series is based on - isn’t this coo? Lobsters walk on land!

I am less fond of books like Wheel of Time, which is sort of the vibe I am getting from Malice as of now. I am about 100 pages in but so far it feels like the characters are pretty standard hero types. I even tried audiobooks to see if that could get me more engaged with the characters. Does the book get darker, more morally grey, or a little more unique?  Would someone with my particular taste benefit from continuing, or should I drop it?"
549,Fantasy,People's Thoughts on Antagonists in the First Law Trilogy? (Spoilers),"Reading the First Law Trilogy was my first series that I read after reading the entirety of Sanderson's published Cosmere work. While I love both, the First Law series was a nice change of scenery after reading so much Sanderson. I think people are correct when they say that Abercrombie's writing and characters are done extremely well.

I have never read other Grim Dark fantasy before nor other Abercrombie, so what I am saying may have been said before or might be obvious.

\*Spoilers beginning\*

I was curious to hear people's opinions on who they thought the antagonist(s)/villain(s) were in the series. Bethod and Khalul are presented as the main advisories through out most series. I don't think I would consider them antagonists though. Both characters are abstract and most informations about them comes from outside sources. Khalul never makes an appearance and almost all information known about him comes from Bayaz (hardly the most reliable source). Bethod only appears briefly, but we find out in book 3 that Logan was the main reason that Bethod became a king

With the main characters, every character is heavily flawed for obvious reasons besides the Dogman. I assume this is a Grim Dark thing. I always think of the protagonist as the person who grows. At the end of the trilogy, the only person that has really changed for the positive is Jezal. I think one could say that Glokta has learned some mercy, but he still keeps Archlecture Sult and tortures him. Logan and Ferro end up exactly where they begun the series. Ferro chases revenge and Logan continues a fighting life in the North. However, I wouldn't say any of these characters were the main antagonist of the series.

I don't think this will be a controversial opinion (Idk maybe it will be), but I would think that Bayaz is the true antagonist in the series. He does fight against the eaters who are objectively bad, but it does not seem like Khalul and the eaters posed an existential threat to world. Bayaz uses the seed, something that can destroy cities, to settle his scores.  I think Bayaz is the antagonist for more reasons other than his own character flaws. For me, Bayaz seems to embody systematic oppression. He lives through the generations, and he controls people through various different means. He has no issues abusing and taken advantage of people, especially the common people. One can only rise so far in the Union with Bayaz and no one can truly be free. Bayaz only serves himself and he created a systems that benefits him the most. A lot of the other characters are bad because of circumstances. Ferro's family was killed. Glokta was tortured and exiled from society. West had an abusive father. Even Logan attempts to change but he can't break the circle of becoming the Bloody Nine any time he is around Northmen. That doesn't give them excuse to act the way they do, but it helps explain their actions. With Bayaz, his ambition and jealousy drive him. Bayaz is a puppet master and he creates an environment that prevents widespread positive change. He does most of this out of sight where people don't know the extent to which they are shackled by the system.

I do see how someone could say that Bayaz only ever did what he thought was necessary, and it's not like he tries to open the divide between sides, but in my opinion, I view him as the main antagonist. This was just an opinion and I have only read the series once, so I'm sure there's stuff I missed.

What do y'all think?"
550,Fantasy,Thoughts on this minotaur reproductive cycle I came up with?,"Okay, so a while back I was looking at certain creatures in D&amp;D where reproduction isn't a simple ""Woman of species X + Man of species X = baby of species X"" matter, and I got to thinking, what if a half-human half-animal creature like a minotaur worked like that?

In my idea, a minotaur hooking up with another minotaur doesn't produce a minotaur baby, but either a human or a cow baby. A minotaur must breed with either a human or a cow to produce another minotaur.

Too gross?"

553,Fantasy,Nuance in your reading,"I know that this is a silly thing to complain about on the internet where opinions have become binary (this is the best thing in the world &lt;-&gt; this is terrible in every sense of the word) and that people always point this out in comments, but I think its something a lot of people need to consider if they want to enjoy reading more.  

***All literary conventions, tropes, and ideas can be good, all literary conventions, tropes, and ideas can be bad.*** 

People will be on this sub saying ""Books should not have x"" and then go on a 1000 word diatribe about how they have hated *x* in every book they've read, and then list two books in the comments. Maybe you've just seen it done poorly? I don't want to rag on these folks because their opinions are of course valid, but I think it limits their options and views on what reading books (and this genre in particular) have to offer. Like the conversation about hard/soft magic systems that took place last week. In the hands of certain authors both can be done well or both can be done poorly.

 I don't even know what the point of this post was. I would just like people to have as much access to all the great art out there as possible. Just something on my mind.

555,Fantasy,Characters with Lives outside the Plot,"In the ebb and flow of reading habits, I've picked up the Vlad Taltos books again.  I read the first when I was in middle school and vaguely remember enjoying it, but not ever moving on with it.  It's been much better received this time, and I think it's something that reflects my broader reading habits growing.

I've learned that I really enjoy characters just living their lives without plot getting in the way all the time (though I do love a nice, heavily plotted novel too).  I think I noticed this trend in myself first when reading Fool's Assassin, by Hobb.  The slice of life nature of an old guy living in retirement with his wife had me far more engaged than I'd been in a while.  Goblin Emperor posed a similar conundrum for me, where simply enjoying the ride was enough.

And now with Jherg and Yendi, I'm enjoying how Vlad so clearly has a well developed life outside of the immediate plot, which I'll chalk up to the author's willingness to not write the books chronologically.  In any case, I've learned that I enjoy 'lived in' characters immensely.

To put my enjoyment of this unlikely ""genre"" into further context i must confess that In my mind the book ""Chariots of the gods?"" By Erich Von Däniken, despite being a wacked out conspiracy theory with no credibility what so ever is without a doubt the greatest sci-fi novel i have ever read.

Unfortunately I've never met anyone else who enjoys these subjects in the same manor that i do, the only people I've ever come across that are even remotely familiar with them are the people who actually belive in such things.

566,Fantasy,Fantasy Romance: Love triangles with a male lead ?,"As a guy in his mid 20s, even though I am not the target audience, I do enjoy the occasional YA fantasy and read along with my little sister.

Seeing this post [Love triangles ruin stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/m4aa0g/love_triangles_ruin_stories/) got me thinking. I have read plenty of stories with female lead and quite a few have the lead picking between two guys, typically between a safe, reliable good guy vs a dangerous anti hero type guy. It's actually a common enough trope: [The Betty Veronica love triangle](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica)

Expanding upon my earlier [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/m4aa0g/love_triangles_ruin_stories/gqu1url/) to the post: I feel like in general fantasy novels with a female lead tend to have a better romantic subplot. There is more focus on feelings, if it is YA, there is more angst, and sometimes all of this is increased when a love triangle is involved.

In contrast Fantasy novels with a male lead tend to have romance as a minor side plot at best, it's mostly just here is your reward for saving the world, you get the girl. We don't know a lot about the girl except for the hero obsessing over her beauty a few times, there is little angst or exploration of feelings. I don't think I have even read one where the guy struggles choosing between two women.

It kind of makes sense in a stereotypical target audience kind of way. It could also be the type of books I am reading. The books I read with female leads generally tend to be YA Fantasy Romance, and the ones I read with the male lead are typically guy goes off to save the world style ones or litrpg or progression fantasy.

So fantasy romance enthusiasts, suggest me series with a male lead that has a pretty important romantic subplot. Bonus for series where it's a guy involved in the center of a love triangle and struggles choosing between two women."
567,Fantasy,A Wild Bingo Guessing Game Appears: Potential Most Popular Books of 2020,"As a self-proclaimed bingo addict, the only thing more fun than constantly changing my mind about what books I want to read for each square is seeing what books *everyone else* chose.

568,Fantasy,Is there a name for this particular type of fantasy?,"So I've been playing Sunless Sea recently and it reminded me of a particular type of fantasy. I don't mean cosmic horror like Lovecraft's or the contemporary versions of it. I don't mean fantasy about dark journeys through seas or skies or similar themes (of which most of the [cited references](https://www.failbettergames.com/sunless-influences/) for the game seem to be).

What I'm talking about is fantasy that isn't that focused in establishing a strict System of Magic and the ways it logically plays out in this magical world, fantasy that isn't as worried with verosimilitude or ""realism"" and kinda feels like an ungrounded fairy tail in which anything can actually happen, fantasy that isn't like afraid of giving its characters, locations and institutions characteristics that sometimes feel even too absurd for a standard fantasy work. So the fantasy can be dark or epic or light or cosmic horror-y or whatever, the point I'm focusing on is the way it treats its magic and its predictability I guess.

The first thing that comes to mind is the webcomic Digger by Ursula Vernon, though I don't know how well known it is. Terry Pratchett/Douglas Adams also give me this vibe, and while I appreciate the satyrical and light humor componentes of their work, it's not that what I'm referring to. It's the particular quality of the unconstrained fantasy, where you feel like anything can truly happen, that is not as bound to its own created magical logic. Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell also does reminds me of this. Some of Borges' works also give me this vibe, in a different way, sometimes. Maybe Le Guin's Earthsea too, but it's been so long since I read it.

Weirdly enough, magical realism (of which I've read a lot since I'm from Latin America) kinda reminds me of this type of fantasy but only during the brief moments in which unpredictable magic interrupts their otherwise verosimile worlds. What I'm referring to is works that have worlds that are fantastical all the time.

**While I appreciate examples and recommendations, what I want to know the most if there's some name or denomination for this type of fantasy.**"

571,Fantasy,What settings feel like the were actually shaped by the magic system of the series?,"I just reread [The Mage Errant](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YYJGRYL/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i5) series by John Bierce and was once again struck by how much the world and setting of that series really feels like it was shaped by the magic system and magical creatures that inhabit it.  It is the small details that slowly add up to the bigger picture of the setting.  For example in the second book a small off hand comment mentions how much larger the moon is than earths moon, then in book 4 we learn how massive the tides of the planet in this setting are.   This leads to coastal cities having to be very carefully placed to deal with the tides. Another example is the stormlight archives where the huge stormwall has shaped plant and animal life, as well as had a huge impact on how people live, and travel.

So I have been curious as to what other series do this really well, having a world that feels like it came about because of the unusual properties of the setting."

Only a few have come close to scratching the itch: The First Law Trilogy, The Traitor Son Cycle, The Inheritance Trilogy, and Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn come to mind first.

I tried Sanderson. I did.  How could I not? But I only made it through a quarter of the Way of Kings and he lost me on character development... I found only a few of them even mildy interesting, and almost all of the dialog awful. (Sorry, just me, I know Sanderson is much-revered here, and that's cool.)

Now I may finally try Malazan... you'd have to live under a fantasy rock to not have seen it recommended here a bazillion times, but for some reason I've been hesitant to pick it up. Probably *because* of the hype. But Malazan lovers, please, give me the quick elevator pitch on why I should delve into this enormous series. Will I find characters I'll come to love and care about?

586,Fantasy,What are fatal flaws in fantasy writing?,"There is a common habit which is being practiced by a bunch of fantasy writers that may ruin a novel: a superiority complex. Ancient weapons like swords or knives should innately be inferior compared to modern weapons namely guns or grenades, oftentimes isn't.

Taking Harry Potter into consider, someone may wonder why some modern Muggle technology tools like landmines or guns could actually be extremely useful. Even simply replacing sending letter by owl with a walkie-talkie would be a dramatical improvement, with the assumption that radios wave exist in aforementioned magical world. 

But that's not even the most irritate issue i encountered. This is what i called Predestined Worldbuilding. Sometimes, a fantasy novel author already decided what was gonna happen (eventually) in their story. For instance, the battle with the red sand in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The liveliness and believability of the environment is undeniable. But then everything have to be reshaped to adapt to that scene, sometimes the feeling of forcefulness is unimmersive and kicked me out of the immersion.

Fantasy is an adorable genre. If being done right, fantasy could make you submerge into a virtual world. It is wonderful and absolutely amazing that we suddenly experience more to the world beyond our life. Regardless of my mild criticism, Harry Potter and Star Wars do this well and have become fantastic worlds of their own.

Avoiding those errors can be the key in keeping your world alive."

2. When did the 9 men with rings become the Nazgul? Before or after the final battle when Sauron was defeated? Were they important or matter when they were human?

3. Everything later with Frodo could have been avoided if Elrond had just shoved Isuldur and the ring into Mt. Doom. ""Cast it into the fire!"" ""No."" ""Wrong answer."" *kicks Isuldur off the bridge into the lava.* No more ring or Sauron. Why Elrond? Why??

4. Elrond was literally there 3000 yrs ago. He saw the ring, knows what it looks like, what it feels like, etc But Gandalf didn't go to Rivendell to ask him how to confirm Bilbo/Frodo's ring was the One? Why Gondor and Isuldur's journals?

5. Why are the hobbits so immune to the one ring's power? Merry, Pippin, Sam, Frodo. All of them either withstood the call of the ring or seemingly don't even care about it. No one can touch, hold, or even look at it without going psycho, except for the adorable men-children who love food.

I've read the books ages ago and none of Tolkien's other works. But I've seen some amazing deep dive discussions on here so...EXPLAIN, EXPLAIN!"

I feel like I was so invested in the Tattersail/Bridge Burner/Darujhistan plotlines and now It feels like I've had the rug ripped out from under me and I'm struggling to keep enough interest to see what happens on the next page. It's not bad and I see the proverbial yarn strings he's drawing to bring this whole world together. But it feels like a lot. I guess my true question is how many novels do I have to read to get to that ""Final Fantasy 7 leaving Midgar moment"" where you know all the systems and main characters and are turned out into the wide world to watch it play out."
601,Fantasy,Review: Among Thieves by M. J. Kuhn,"Rating: 7.5/10


Synopsis


A thrilling fantasy debut—a high-stakes heist novel set in a gritty world of magic and malice, and perfect for fans of Six of Crows!
In just over a year’s time, Ryia Cautella has already earned herself a reputation as the quickest, deadliest blade in the dockside city of Carrowwick—not to mention the sharpest tongue. But Ryia Cautella is not her real name.
For the past six years, a deadly secret has kept her in hiding, running from town to town, doing whatever it takes to stay one step ahead of the formidable Guildmaster—the sovereign ruler of the five kingdoms of Thamorr. No matter how far or fast she travels, his servants never fail to track her down…but even the most powerful men can be defeated.
Ryia’s path now leads directly into the heart of the Guildmaster’s stronghold, and against every instinct she has, it’s not a path she can walk alone. Forced to team up with a crew of assorted miscreants, smugglers, and thieves, Ryia must plan her next moves very carefully. If she succeeds, her freedom is won once and for all…but unfortunately for Ryia, her new allies are nearly as selfish as she is, and they all have plans of their own.


Review


Thanks to the publisher and author for an advance reading copy of Among Thieves for review consideration. This did not influence my thoughts or opinions.

Among Thieves is an engaging, suspense-filled heist novel with blistering pace, an intriguing cast of characters, and plenty of machinations to keep you guessing until the very end. Kuhn shows a ton of promise with this fantasy debut and is going to be a name to keep an eye on.

Yeah… so I haven’t read Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo *anticipates being shouted at and/or thrown items hurtling toward noggin* so I can’t just jump on the hype train that comes with the blurb. Having said that, the cover is what stood out to me, along with a very interesting premise and me being a sucker for trad published debut fantasy novels.

The author takes a very interesting approach with the storyline as she weaves the plot through multiple POVs, each taking on their own chapters and giving you their perspectives of the happenings throughout all of the trials. It is refreshing to get various accounts rather than all characters being mashed into the “mercenary band / band of thieves” grouping and getting a one liner here and there from each. You are able to explore the world through different eyes, emotions, motivations, etc.

Having said that, the characters and the world did feel like they could’ve been fleshed out a little more. Ryia is probably going to be the character that most sticks with me because: A. She is introduced first, and B. She has the most interesting storyline. I mean, who is she really? What motivates her? How in the world did she become the “Butcher of Carrowwick”? All of these questions deserve answers, and while we don’t get the full story we are looking for, there is enough there to keep you wanting more.

In regard to the world-building, it tended to take a backseat to the characters. What I mean is, while this is a VERY character-driven novel in a “gritty world full of magic and malice”, the world is really just there to give these characters somewhere to go. Does that make sense? I couldn’t get a great feel for the streets, the catacombs, the castles, the Auction, the Lottery, etc. They were all very surface but serviceable for the storyline. Thing is, I could look past all this because sometimes the world doesn’t TRULY matter if the characters grab you enough.

The magic system is pretty straight forward but offered some very intense and enjoyable moments. I’d love to know more of its history and maybe forthcoming novels can expand on it a little bit. But what really shines are the machinations. While this is a “found family” type novel, you will soon find out that while people seem to have your back, they are just as likely to stab you in it. Kuhn excels at consistently flipping the tables end over end, smattering them with axes, and then hurling expletives at them until they finally give up the ghost. Even then, she still isn’t done. Freaking brilliant.

All in all, if you enjoy heist stories with plenty of intrigue and are ok with not diving too deep into characters or world-building, Among Thieves is a worthwhile read. I liken it to a favorite of mine, Fool’s Gold (The Dragon Lords #1) by Jon Hollins except with all “mostly” human characters and not soo many dragons."

In fact, it’d probably be summed up by The Transvaal Saga (after *Hatchet*), Redwall as a child, the first books of Dune, Michael Crichton’s Timeline (I do love time travel), and the River God series (Wilbur Smith). The latter is what steered my budding musical tastes toward the more extreme end, via *Nile* who had just released their album at the time I came across the series.

That’s about it that I can remember.

Along with these I've read The Witcher (Andrzej Sapkowski) and the Mistborn (Brandon Sanderson) series and I thoroughly enjoyed them both.

612,Fantasy,Four Mini Bingo Reviews - Audiobook,"**Background:** I've set myself a stretch goal of filling four cards (100 books) for this year's bingo. As I read four books for each square, I'll share my mini reviews - and will also be forcing myself to pick the book I think best represents the spirit of the square and/or that I most enjoyed reading.

**Thoughts on this square:** There's a reason I left this one to last, and it's because I used it as a cheat square to fill in with random audiobooks I didn't use elsewhere, so it's not much help for others in deciding what to read.

**Reviews**

[In His Majesty's Service (Temeraire #1-3)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13518120-in-his-majesty-s-service) by Naomi Novik (hard)

Rating: 4/5

Other squares: magical pet, politics, colour in the title (books 2-3)

The Napoleonic War, with dragons. As someone who also loves historical fiction, these books are right up my alley. I adore the bromance between Lawrence and Temeraire, as well as Temeraire's burgeoning political instincts. They can get a little bogged down in battle strategy and military talk at points, but otherwise I'm really enjoying this series and have already continued on. Simon Vance is also a fantastic narrator: his Temeraire voice is uncanny. 

[Beguilement (The Sharing Knife #1)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61898.Beguilement) by Lois McMaster Bujold

Rating: 2.5/5

Other squares: romantic fantasy 

I was really excited to start this series after reading \*The Curse of Chalion\* for r/fantasy book club, but was ultimately disappointed. There's some really promising world-building regarding the Lakewalkers - a community of necromancers who protect local communities against the supernatural in a pseudo American Midwest setting - but the pacing is glacial and the story ultimately gets bogged down in a pretty boring 'meet the parents' romance. Speaking of which, I'm not against age-gap relationships in general, and both characters are mutually interested and very happy to consent despite the 20-year age difference, but this book literally starts with the older man rescuing the young naivete from being almost raped by a bandit, which feels kinda weird. 

[The Story of Silence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51051711-the-story-of-silence) by Alex Myers

Rating: 4/5

Other squares: politics 

This is a rich, character-driven Arthurian fantasy about the titular Silence, a cis girl who is raised as a boy so that he can one day inherit his father's estate, and their complex experience of gender identity. The prose is excellent, and Silence is an admirable character who remains dedicated to being the best person possible, regardless of what life throws at them. As a cis person I won't say much about the trans rep except to note that I could sense the honesty in the author's portrayal. 

[The Amber Spyglass](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18122.The_Amber_Spyglass) (His Dark Materials #3) by Phillip Pullman 

Rating: 2/5

Other squares: colour in the title, politics 

The final part of my re-read, after watching the HBO show. This series was a dear favourite as a kid, and upon re-reading as an adult... the first two books stood the test of time, but this last installment really didn't. Character development and the original sense of adventure is increasingly overlooked in favour of the heavy-handed critique of religion and, while I love Will and Lyra, the treatment of their relationship and the equation of romance with adulthood in this last book set this ace person's teeth on edge.

613,Fantasy,"A fantasy series with really good, detailed maps","I love poring over maps and imagining what it might be like walking through and looking around city streets, palace and temple complexes, buildings, and just spaces generally.

614,Fantasy,Books with a protagonist in non-typical profession,"Hi,

I’m looking for a book(or anything really) that focuses on a character whose primary profession(using the term a bit broadly) is not typically seen in fantasy. A typical fantasy profession/position to me includes any martial, thief/assassin, crime-related or ruler/royalty role. Books that I think fall into this category, and that I’ve enjoyed, include:

-A Natural History of Dragons (Naturalist/Biologist)
-The Beast Player (some kind of zoologist or vet or animal handler)
-A wizard’s Guide to Defensive Baking (baker)
-Spinning Silver (money-lender and servant-ish)
-Alphabet of Thorn (Linguist/academic)


The last two examples are a little weak, but I hope the others show what I’m looking for. Some books that I haven’t liked and fall into this category are:

-Sourdough (computer scientist/baker-ish)
-the Bees (lots of roles)
-Torn (tailor)

I disliked these books for various reasons, so if you have a book rec that’s similar to them, please still recommend it.

I don’t mind if the book centers completely on the character and their profession such as in A Natural History of Dragons, or has a wider scope, but I’d like the profession to have some impact on the story. I would also like the book to focus on the characters; The fewer the better."

I would still appreciate a high level of writing (literary!?) and prose, world building and characters, but otherwise not fussed. Something captivating, interesting, and well written.

I’ve read Malazan, CoBC, asSoIaf, Dune, tons of sci fi, LoTR, most of the big ones.

I'm just looking for a simple answer like 5/10 vs ../10

617,Fantasy,[Book Review] Shrouds of Darkness (Brooklyn Shadows #1) by Brock Deskins,"4/5

I love vampire books. I especially love urban fantasy vampire books. This is partially due to how much I adored the Vampire: The Masquerade during my teenage years. So, I was all in for Brock Deskin's Brooklyn Shadows series that follow the adventures of undead detective Leo. Leo is a lovably repulsive character. A bit like Johnny Lawrence in Cobra Kai, he's stuck a few decades behind the times and compensates for it by being as big a jerk to people as humanly possible. Fans of series like the Dresden Files and the Hellequin Chronicles will probably find this book enjoyable.

The premise is a werewolf accountant who does work for the mob in New York finds himself kidnapped by forces unknown. Leo is hired by the werewolf's daughter to track him down and see if he's alive or dead. This proves problematic as while Leo is a decent enough detective, he's managed to burn every single bridge he's made in the supernatural community. The vampires of the Enclave loathe him as a failed Sheriff, the werewolves despise him as a vampire killer, and the police believe he's a multiple mass murdering hitman [which is true from a certain point of view].

The primary appeal of the story is watching Leo stumble around, offending people left and right in hopes that they let slip something useful to his investigation. What follows is a decent enough mystery that involves the mysterious ""Cure"" for vampirism that was long ago abandoned as unusually toxic, a sudden upswing in the vampire population of New York, attacks on the mob by forces unknown, and the planned installation of a London-esque CCTV network across the city.

Part of what makes the story work is Leo actively shoots himself in the foot repeatedly by not caring about anything other than himself. It takes awhile for him to put the pieces together because he ignores anything that doesn't directly relate to his case. He's really kind of a cruddy detective as his attitude, cynicism, and nihilism prevent him from developing much in the way of contacts. He has a couple of in a hacker named Mo Money (a self-granted nickname that Leo mocks repeatedly), a morgue attendant, and an incredibly effective lawyer but these are the exceptions instead of the rule.

I think my favorite character of the book is the police office Castillo. Castillo is basically the anti-Murphy for Dresden File fans. She's a dedicated hard-working female police officer absolutely set against our protagonist who seems to get away with murder, literally, on a regular basis. I actually support these two getting together and think it would be a spicy romance. Leo's actual girlfriend, Katherine, is interesting enough but doesn't have the same level of spark.

Does this book have any flaws? Eh, I found it a little weird that we opened up with a perspective other than Leo's at the start of the book despite this being in first person. I also feel like we could have referenced Leo's past with so many characters more. As a vampire, I feel like he would have some more interesting history with various characters. Still, this is a minor set of issues overall and didn't impact my enjoyment much.

In conclusion, I feel this is a solid and entertaining urban fantasy/horror adventure novel. Leo is an antihero that will be an acquired taste to some readers but I personally loved him. I recommend picking up the audiobook novel in particular since the narrator does a fantastic job."

619,Fantasy,My love for fantasy has been reborn in the form of audio books. Please give me more,"So it all started with NotW. Since a few months ago, I've listened to all of Mistborn and all the current Stormlight Archives. I've considered listening to more sanderson, mostly for Michael Kramer, but I really just want to start somewhere fresh again.

I've seen Malazan recommend, as well as Joe Abercrombie and Tad Williams, but none of the readers stand out to me as preferable to the others, so that hasn't helped my decision really. I considered WoT but the quality of the recording on audible is a bit aged for my taste. I'm just afraid to waste my credit is what it really comes down to. Which is also part of the reason I haven't listened to the Alloy of Law series, too short to waste a credit on imo

Just give me something thick and juicy to really sink my teeth into, like you can with Stormlight. Something evolving and epic with magic and super sick battles. Something badass and gritty, full of characters that make me sad when they're gone. Something that leaves me a withered husk, rotting like a papaya after days of constant listening, not even stopping for a sippy break or second breakfast.

It's just that...I miss Kaladin and Syl so much, I'm considering just listening through them all again. Somebody stop me"
620,Fantasy,Fantasy Words and Names that Have Unintended Real Meanings in Other Languages,"With the amount of made up words and names in fantasy, I imagine that authors accidentally use words that have real meanings in other languages all the time. I wonder if authors Google them to make sure they aren't accidentally naming things after something dumb or silly. It doesn't bother me too much but sometimes, it does change the mood or feeling of some moments significantly when a particular funny instance of it occurs (and it happens often to me since I speak a few languages and dialects). I started thinking about this when I was reading M.L. Wang's **Sword of Kaigen**, because the term *""nyama""* in the book sounded like *""niama""*, which is Cantonese or Hokkien for *""your mother!""* and it's used mainly as a rude intejecting like *""shit""* or *""fuck""*.

In the same book, the term *""Thulanism""* and *""Thulanist""* is used to refer to an anti-imperialist political ideology and its proponents. *""Tulan""* is Hokkien for pig's penis.

One that still makes me laugh one the incantations Agnieszka used: ""Alamak"". In the Malaysian language, it is used as an expression of woeful surprise, kinda like ""Oh  shit"" or ""Oh my god"". The instance is was used is this:

&gt;The guards all looked at each other uncertainly. Before they could decide what to do about me, I whispered, ""Alamak, alamak,"" and walked straight on through the locked doors between them.

I heard that in John Gwynne's upcoming *Shadow of the Gods*, there is a character named Berak, which means ""shit"" or ""poop"" in Malay/Indonesian. Indonesian author and booktuber Petrik Leo told me:

&gt; Imagine my laughter when the book is being super serious and it said ""Berak brings blood with him."" 

I like to think we have an international bunch here so I am wondering if there are any more such instances of unintentional hilarity. Did you encounter any fantasy names/words that means something funny or inappropriate in your native languages?"

The Wretched: The Fateless Throne Book 1, by Brad Carsten

[Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Wretched-Fateless-Throne-Book-ebook/dp/B07T5Y2H8D)

Review:

I didn't read the blurb for this book until after I finished.  I would not have read the blurb and picked up this book. Not because the blurb is bad, it just isn't the type of book I would ever have read before. But I am very glad that I did.

This book clicked for me. I had a crazy couple of weeks at work, and I expected to be posting this next week. I ripped through the book over the weekend in two days.  It has it's rough edges for sure, and gun to my head I would say it was self published if I hadn't known one way or the other.  But that also means the ceiling is incredibly high for this author, and I'm eagerly waiting for book two, because I have some questions that need answering.

The book starts off great, and really sets up the stage for the main protagonist, Liam.  Instantly hooked, and such an interesting and unique premise kicks it off.  I was really grooving through the first 10% and then the author throws a curveball. I was honestly dumbfounded. This amazing hook and start to this book, and the author was like, nah just kidding let's actually go over here.  But by the end, it was so worth it. That intro was so neccessary to set some of the pieces up for later, and I hope for book number two (I am waiting for a certain someone to return Brad, don't let me down!).

As the story transitions into the main plot, one of his friends steps into the spotlight and commands one of the POVs.  This characters arc is pretty incredible, and is just so easy to root for.  It's hard to describe a character as relatable when he's stepping in between the world of the living and the dead, but he just kind of is somehow. His story is the one I'm looking forward to next.

Speaking of the living and the dead, the magic system and the world building is a breathe of fresh air. So unique, so fresh. And the way it's described just makes sense. A lot of small things that just kind of mesh together extremely well.  It can be a bit loosey goosey at times, but I like that. It brings a certain level of mystery to it (and I've only been a fan of softer magic systems anyway, don't shoot me).

The third POV, Kaylyn (quick FYI, her name is wrong in the Amazon blurb), is the main driver of the plot I would say. The author leaves you guessing throughout much of the story as to what side she's really on.  It's made pretty clear by the end, although I have a sneaking suspicion I may be getting duped. But I could just be paranoid. She is the primary magic user throughout the story, and through her you learn more about how the magic system works.  I didn't quite care for her as much as the other characters. Not sure what it was, but it just didn't jive with me.  I think a lot of her backstory felt a bit forced, and towards the end there was quite a bit of backstory that killed some of the pacing for me. If that bit at the end could have been sprinkled in throughout, and the main takeaway of that long scene saved for the end, it may have worked much better. And I think introducing a character so late in the game that had a very large impact took away from the significance of the climax. I imagine it could have packed an emotional punch, but the as the reader it just fell a bit flat for me.

All in all, it was a fantastic read. Fresh, fun, exciting, mysterious. It had me turning the page all weekend, and I'm looking forward to the next book.

624,Fantasy,Looking for the best powerful duels/combat books [recommendations],"I'm looking for books where the characters are rich and dark, ideally are more powerful than regular people, where powerful characters fight but not necessarily the full-on army scenes.  


I'm talking Sadius in shard plate smashing troops 20 metres in the air with a shard hammer, books with the epicness of Adolin vs Eshoni. Kaladin vs The Chaser etc.  


Darth Bane + Darth Zannah vs 6 Jedi.

&amp;#x200B;

The bloody nine duelling, Gorst slaughtering his way through the heroes.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of Shardplate clad warriors battling or Jedi vs sith lord is the idea I'm looking for, the really epic scenes which really grip you.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the wheel of time, Brandon Sanderson, Joe Abercrombie are common answers to this."

633,Fantasy,What's objectively bad fantasy book or series do you enjoy anyway?,"For me, it's *The Pillars of Reality* by Jack Campbell.  When I see a post asking for series that blend magic and technology, it's my first thought.  But then I find myself wanting to qualify my recommendation by saying the world building is minimal, and the characterization isn't great, and the ""foreshadowing"" is sometimes more like a roadmap, and the ""romance"" is stilted and awkward, until I'm trying to remember why I like the series in the first place.  

But I do.  I love that series, to the point that I've read it five or six times.  I'm attached to the main characters, and their attempts at figuring out how feelings work, and the series' straightforward, pulp fantasy action, and a world where the lines between good and evil are clearly drawn, and the main characters get along without betraying each other, or having someone 'turn to the dark side'.  But I've never worked up the nerve to actually recommend it because, even though I love it, I have to admit it's pretty bad.

Ray Feist's *Riftwar* cycle seems like it would make for a good series of movies, though I think that there might already be a TV series in the works for that one. I just started reading *Dagerspell*, the first book in Katharine Kerr's *Deverry* Saga, and while I thought the whole premise with the girl who can see things other people can't see looked interesting, the way the book was told out of order really ruined its film potential. Same with  Sara Douglass's *Wayfarer Redemption* series, the first book looked like great movie material at first but its downer ending killed that possibility."

**The Memoirs of Lady Trent** is one of my absolute favourite series and Isabella Camherst might be my favourite character in fantasy books, so far! Lately I started **the Steerswoman series** (First 2 books only at the moment) and Rowan strikes me as a very similar character to Isabella which in turn, made me think that they would have probably been very good friends as they both value knowledge and are naturally curious. 

I absolutely love the sense of adventure both have for the slim chance that they might get to know a lot more than what they already know. The way their books focused on their explorations of a mystery while making sure to also explore the cultures of the world around them and the people was just a treat to read about. 

So I’m now curious if other people (I’m sure I’m not the only one!) had similar experiences when reading. So which two (or more) character from different series do you think would be great friends if they ever met?

651,Fantasy,Creativity VS Using interesting things from other works?,"This post is not to say these two things are somehow separate ideas or points, but that when faced with a choice how do you think someone should go? 

  In your opinion how does creativity, that is to say, unique/ different worldbuilding and plotlines matter compared to using something someone else has used but in your own way?  I think somethings are just tropes of a genre like a mad king, or a young hero, wise mentor, etc with fantasy.  Then some things are a core aspect and more ""unique"" to that world the example that sparked this discussion in the first place is Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series.  

I was beta reading for an author and his prologue was basically ""Group of powerful mages want to punish the people of this land and protect powerful magical items from people. In the interest of this, they cover the and in ash and those that fail to escape or brought back as guardians in an undead state."" This prologue is some 2000 years prior I think too the main storyline but I thought it was an interesting intro that showed powerful items, the collapse of the ancient empire that made everyone move to where they live now, etc.  The author received feedback that it was too similar to Mistborn because of ""falling ash"". 

This is where the real point of the conversion starts, does the overwhelming popularity of a series that includes something core to its plot or world then ""control"" the market on that topic?  So do we never again get a story about a world set into collapse with falling ash, or schools of magic(Harry Potter), or people on a quest to destroy a powerful object(LOTR)?  

  Does it just being an interesting story or worldbuilding element mean authors should be free to use it or should they avoid such things because someone jumped on it first and anyone else is to be left ""Mistborn clone"", ""LOTR clone"" etc and shouldn't touch these elements in their own story in their own taste?  

 I don't think it's right to have one story own a concept or plot point when someone else might come along and a world of falling ash with 90% unique other things that are just as good as Mistborn one day."
652,Fantasy,Review and Fan Art: Dragonslayer by Duncan M Hamilton,"**The Review**

This book. Oh dear. What to write about this book. I genuinely did love it, but at the same time, I felt it, much like the main main character’s life at the start of the story, fell well short of its potential. 

This book was almost awesome. It was so, so close to being awesome. Drunk has-been protagonist who is given one last chance to reclaim his former glory? Oh, sign me the heck up. This kind of thing is my catnip. And indeed I think Mr. Hamilton did an excellent job portraying a depressed alcoholic protagonist. Guillot’s struggles and triumphs and pitfalls and failures and climbing back out of those failures all felt very realistic and well-realized and made me really root for him to succeed. I also enjoyed reading about the side characters, from the talented witch on the run to the uptight soldier-mage who ultimately forms a reluctant friendship with the hero. 

A lot of the negative reviews on goodreads complained about this book being too cliche or generic, that they’d seen this thing a million times before. To which I ask, where are all these alleged millions of other books about sad drunk has-beens who are called back into action, because I need more of these, MORE I say. And indeed, if you do like stories about sad alcoholics who are charged with killing the last of a dragon species which was thought to be extinct, I highly recommend the Bone Ships by RJ Barker. But I’d love even more than just the two. 

But as for this book, while I did enjoy it, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should be enjoying it more, and sometimes I put it down for long stretches and had to really force myself to pick it up again.

The most difficult parts to get through were probably the sections from the villains’ points of view. Villain POVs are always difficult to get right. If the villain is nuanced and interesting, it can be done well, but a lot of times it ends up being pages and mages of devious mustache twirling, which get somewhat boring and take valuable time away from reading about the actual heroes who I care about. This book did a bit of both. The sections from the point of view of Guillot’s long-time rival Prince Bishop Amaury were by far my least favorite parts of the book, and I saw no necessity for the narrative to keep reiterating what an ass he is. On the other hand, I did enjoy the scenes from the point of view of the dragon, because ironically he seemed a lot more human than the prince bishop. The dragon is, as far as he knows, the last of his kind, so I feel like he is perfectly justified in his self-righteous anger.

This, I fear, was my other big problem with the story, is that not a single one of the human characters treats dragon slaying with any nuance whatsoever. True, the dragon is wrecking towns, and the humans should probably stop him. But the only reason the dragon is wrecking towns is because he is *understandably pissed off* that *his entire species was killed off.* The past genocide against a self-aware, sentient race is highly celebrated, and the people we are supposed to be rooting for are all too gleeful to commit genocide again. This made even otherwise wonderful and well thought out characters difficult to root for. I would have liked this story a heck of a lot more if even one character had even *tried* to effing communicate. Especially since the hero and the dragon both lost their wives and children, so I was really hoping to see them find some common ground there, but alas, it was not to be.

The handling of the death of the main character’s wife and child is another thing I could rant about at length, but I feel like I’ve been too mean so far to this poor book, which I promise I really did actually enjoy, so I’ll just suffice it to say it could have been better done.

I know it sounds like I hated this book, but I actually really did love it, I just felt like it was so close to being amazing rather than just good that I’m afraid I’m being more harsh than I otherwise would have. You can be sure that I fully intend to read the heck out of the sequels.

653,Fantasy,Baru Cormorant fan theory: The Lightning (Spoilers for book 3),"Over the past decade and a half, there's been a growing number of fantasy series diving deeper and deeper into science- both hard and social sciences- for inspiration. That's not to say it didn't happen in the past, of course, but something just feels *different* about this trend. Jemisin's Broken Earth trilogy with geology is probably the most prominent example at the moment, but Seth Dickinsin's Baru Cormorant series draws just as deeply from the wellspring of science, but from half a dozen fields at minimum, and almost certainly more that I didn't notice.

A couple months ago, [I did a fan theory post trying to figure out some of the scientific mechanisms behind another series that's a part of this trend, RJ Barker's Tide Child Trilogy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/kpk2mv/call_of_the_bone_ships_review_spoiler_free/). (Spoilers for that series, obviously, though concealed behind spoiler tags.) I just recently got a book of my own off to my editor, and having spent the past couple weeks recovering, my fingers started getting itchy to do some writing again, so I decided to limber up by doing another fan theory post to try and figure out the mystery that's been bugging me the most about Baru Cormorant:

What the hell is the deal with the lightning at the end of book 3?

(Lots of spoilers ahead, no spoiler tags.)

In the last chapter of The Tyrant Baru Cormorant, a lost ship lands on a mysterious continent, far to the east. It's not the first ship to do so, but landings have been exceptionally rare, and fraught with disaster. While searching the mountains near the shore for trees to replace their mast, they stumble across a bizarre, terrifying scene: A group of armored figures with prisoners, trailing chains across the ground, walking through a ceaseless lightning storm unharmed, who then proceed to sacrifice their leader to the lightning, then force their prisoners to eat the brains of the sacrificed leader.

It would be easy to claim that it's just magic, but none of the magic in the series so far has been blatantly physical. Instead, it's revolved around the manipulation of social structures and expectations. Every other supposed magic- the Cancrioth, the glowing pools of the south (geologic nuclear reactors), etc- has all turned out to have specific scientific causes. So I'm going to assume that the lightning (and the other weirdness) does to. 

And I think I've got an explanation.

**Let's start with the easiest part: The lightning itself.**

High frequencies of lightning strikes are nothing new- lightning can vary wildly according to meteorological conditions. The state of Florida damn near gets more lightning strikes each year (228 per square mile) than the entire western US. Lake Catatumbo, in Venezuela, gets more than 280 lightning strikes per hour, 10 hours a day, up to 160 days a year. The village of Kifuka in the Congo was the previous record holder, before the data was reanalyzed, at over 400 lightning strikes per square mile per year.

So extreme lightning frequencies are plausible enough, but the lightning frequency of the lightning mountains in book 3 seem to far surpass those in our world. Of course, Baru's world seems far more methodologically extreme than our own, but the high frequency of ball lightning, St. Elmo's fire on land, and other weird lightning phenomena, seems to indicate that might be a bit of a stretch.

Geology, however, can have a huge influence on lightning as well. Lightning strikes are super common during volcanic eruptions, for instance- photos of lightning striking erupting volcanoes are incredibly common. Volcanic lightning, however, is primarily caused by ash particles rubbing together in midair in eruption plumes, or ice particles forming at high altitudes in the eruption plume. (There's a LOT of water vapor in explosive volcanic eruptions. It's essential to the process, in fact.) Volcanic lightning might also be a product of radioactive materials charging the atmosphere if they're present in the eruption, but that's still somewhat speculative.

There doesn't seem to be any active eruptions going on near the everlasting lightning storm, however. The area is super geologically active (columnar basalt at the shore, evidence of major lava flows in the past, hot springs, the mountain range is super jagged and therefore pretty young), but no indications of active volcanism going on near them. There is another, alternate geological explanation, however.

Namely, a ferric batholith. That is, a huge underground magma chamber that hasn't breached to the surface. Most magma chambers are granitic, and granite doesn't have jack shit in the way of metal in it, but given the far greater apparent geological activity of Baru's world, as well as its relative youth, a batholith with iron rich is somewhat plausible. (Especially given the presence of hot springs.) It's clearly got to be an active, still molten batholith, but it could, hypothetically, act as something of a massive dynamo/electromagnet/something of the sort (look, I'm not an engineer, I studied rocks in school), which, in concert with meteorological conditions, could absolutely explain the perpetual lightning storm.

There are three types of geological processes that commonly form batholiths that might fit. The first, and least plausible, is a subduction zone, but without going into too much detail, that doesn't really fit. (The magma tends to be more iron-poor and granitic.) The second is a little more likely- a rift zone. Rift zones, where a tectonic plate decides to just go ""fuck it"" and start ripping in half, are fucking weird, and anything goes. (Like Ol Doinyo Lengai, the weirdest volcano on the planet.) Rift zones are seriously the planet's geology after taking too many drugs.

Third, and most plausibly, a mantle plume. A mantle plume is a giant rising column through the mantle, punching up towards the earth's surface. (The mantle isn't actually liquid- the outer core might be liquid, but the mantle is actually, uh... well, moves like really slow peanut butter? A liquid that's as strong as steel? I dunno how to explain it exactly, Earth's mantle is WEIRD. Materials simply don't behave the way we're used to under that much heat and pressure, and plus we're studying them through the entire thickness of the Earth's crust.) Mantle plumes are far hotter than the mantle around them, and easily melt through the earth's crust. They're largely stationary, so as tectonic plates slide over them, the mantle plumes carve paths through the earth's crust, leaving immense volcanic tracks across the Earth's surface. Hawaii is one of the most famous mantle plume trails, but there are plenty of others as well. Yellowstone, for instance. Mantle plume magma is a type of mafic rock, which, among other traits, is highly iron rich. 

Let's go with a mantle plume. For one thing, the columnar basalts on the beach are a strong piece of evidence for it- basalt is a product of mantle plumes, more often than not. (If you want apocalyptic nightmares, go read about [flood basalts, the single most common cause of global mass extinctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_basalt).)

**The Armor**

The next question is pretty easy- how does plate armor protect the mysterious figures from the lightning?

Well, in special effects shows involving electric arcs, performers actually wear full-body chainmail suits. When the electrical arcs strike them, the electricity passes harmlessly through the chainmail into the ground. It works as a lightning rod, essentially. And armor covered in chains dragging on the ground? Would absolutely work for the same purpose.

**BRAAINNNSSSSS**

Alright, this is where we get to the really weird part: What the hell is going on with the brain-eating?

My theory?

Parasites, of course. BRAAAAAAIN PARASITES.

Seriously, parasites are a super reliable go-to when an organism starts behaving in bizarre, suicidal, almost ritualistic manners, especially when it involves an organism climbing or going out into the open to die. [Fungus forcing ants to climb to great heights, then lock themselves to grass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis).[Worms that blind snails to light, making them remain out in the open longer where birds might see them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucochloridium_paradoxum). (While pumping back and forth inside their antenna to mimic a caterpillar, to help attract the birds.) [Flatworms that have a ridiculous five-species lifecycle, which includes ants climbing blades of grass to get eaten by sheep or cattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicrocoelium_dendriticum). [A protazoa that makes rats sexually attracted to cat urine, causing them to wander out into cat territory, then get eaten by cats.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii) (Who then spreads that parasite to humans! It gets in our brain and alters our behavior, and 30-50% of the human population is infected with it.)

The leader of the armored figures is described as ""stooped over, staggering as if under a burden.""  They has to be helped onto the toppled stone monolith that's being used as a makeshift altar by the others, where the leader then sheds its armor with ""shocking speed"". It then uses some sort of long pole to attract the lightning. After the lightning kills the leader, the other figures force the prisoners to eat the leader's brains. 

That sounds a LOT like a brain parasite lifecycle that's been ritualized into a culture. It's well fitting with the themes and worldbuilding of Baru Cormorant- there's an entire culture built around the preservation of immortal cancer lines, for instance. It also has a strong  resonance with the themes of colonialism in the books- the series is absolutely all about infected large, complex things from the inside- that's literally Baru's plan with the Masquerade. And brain parasites fit that theme in a very similar way as the Cancrioth do.

The shambling behavior of the leader most definitely sounds like the behavior of an organism infected with a brain parasite. I don't think the leader was actually *directing* the others, I think they were following along behind someone who had finally been overwhelmed by parasitic instincts.

The parasite seems to have some sort of cultural significance, and is clearly being deliberately preserved, but it's just as clear that it's not a particular honor to be sought to get infected, considering that they're feeding it to prisoners.

So: What sort of parasite is it? 

The direct consumption of brain matter for transmission seems vaguely akin to prions, primitive self-organizing organic molecules that are arguably even less alive than viruses (that's a whole bizarre argument of its own). Prions cause diseases like Mad Cow Disease and Kuru, and are often spread by consumption of brain and nervous system material. They also, however, tend to just kind of... melt your brain. And I can't honestly think of what link a prion would want with lightning.

A flatworm, mollusc, crustacean, or other animal parasite would probably be killed or injured by the lightning, so probably make poor candidates. Tardigrades could also likely survive lightning, but only in their dormant state. (Tardigrades aren't actually indestructible while swimming around and eating. It's when they go into their dormant state to conserve resources or to survive extreme conditions that they become borderline indestructible. And I struggle to think of a reason why they'd *want* to be struck by lightning. Also, there are no known parasitic tardigrades.)

And yes, there are parasitic molluscs and crustaceans, and no, I don't recommend researching them, I'm only linking to relatively less horrifying parasites in this post. Relatively being the key word. Also, if you value your sanity, NEVER look up parasitic isopods. (If I were kinder, I wouldn't leave that warning there to tempt you. THE CURSED KNOWLEDGE DEMANDS TO BE SHARED, THOUGH.)

The lightning as part of the lifecycle is an interesting clue, and brings something to mind- successional species. After a forest fire, there is a particular order in which the flora returns to the land, and some plants have actually evolved to rely on forest fires. Many plants (including some coniferous trees, like lodgepole pines) actually RELY on forest fires to grow- their seeds don't germinate until exposed to fire. These species are known as pyrophilious species, and being lightning activated isn't THAT much weirder than being fire activated. Heck, some prophilic plants actively encourage forest fires, like eucalyptus trees do with their highly flammable oils. So maybe we're talking parasitic plants, here?

Probably not, unfortunately. Parasitic plants parasitise other plants, not animals.

But you know what other type of life is often pyrophilious?

That's right, it's FUNGUS TIME.

There are [species of fungus that are reliant on forest fires to give them a chance to grow](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191025113007.htm), usually early in the succession lifecycle. The spores often seem to actually be activated by the fire after years or decades of dormancy in the soil. They even wait between fires *inside other organisms*. Seems to fit pretty well, doesn't it?

So, a parasitic fungus evolves alongside this absurd lightning system. It learns to infest animal brains, and its reproductive cycle is activated when its host is killed by lightning. Scavengers eat the brains (and the activated fungal spores inside it), and then get infested themselves. More, the fungus seems to be able to alter the behavior of its hosts to force them to expose themselves to the lightning.

Then humans encounter it, and form a religion, or a punishment, or some sort of cultural ritual around it. 

And then the Masquerade encounters *them.*

Also, remember Svirakir, the cryptarch Apparitor? The one with who ""bears the lightning"" within him, after getting struck by it on the same mysterious continent this ship found? Maybe the lightning did something bizarre to his neurochemistry- lightning's known to do that, and bizarre traumatic injuries to the brain are, uh, kinda a core theme of the series.

Or, maybe, just maybe, he got infected by the fungus himself while he was over in the lightning lands. Maybe what he's interpreting as the lightning within him is actually the fungus, going through its lifecycle. Maybe, as it progresses, it's sending signals into his brain to call him back to the lightning, so it can continue its lifecycle. In fact, Svir explicitly thinks about how the ""lightning haunted their dreams, summoning them back east across the Mother of Storms to the supercontinent."" The lightning told him that ""he had a destiny across the farthest sea.

Maybe the lifetime he wants to spend exploring the supercontinent with his love Lindon is going to be a particularly short one. Maybe that destiny is just to be a womb for parasitic fungal spores.

(I'm not sure whether the lightning striking him is an essential part of the fungus' lifecycle in the first place, or whether it was coincidental to him getting infected. Maybe it's in the water, and you have to get hit by lightning to activate it in the first place? But then why feed others the brains of its victims? There's definitely *something* I'm missing in the lifecycle- I'm not sure whether I lack the necessary evidence or whether I'm just missing something.)

**BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAAANNNNN?????**

The reaction of the Masquerade citizens to the lightning people is absolutely key, and part and parcel with the mindset of the Masquerade. One character even says, in response to being asked what is happening, that they have no worldly idea, ""But it's terrible. It's atrocious."" They see something they're ignorant of, and they immediately react with revulsion, terror, and hate. They immediately and explicitly interpret it as an existential threat to all civilization. The last line of the book involves a character wondering what the Emperor would do about the lightning people.

Here's the thing: I don't think the lightning people actually *do* pose a threat to the Masquerade, or all of civilization. I don't think this is some apocalyptic scenario, where everyone but the prisoners was infected, and the infected were forcing the uninfected to join them. I believe this for two reasons.

First, on a scientific basis, the presumed parasite just... doesn't make a lot of sense as some apocalyptic infection. My gut feeling is that most of the figures weren't actually infected by the parasite- it's actually evolutionarily disadvantageous for a parasite to infect too much of a population, because it could put its own home/food source at risk. 

And the mind control behaviors of brain parasites aren't exactly super sophisticated, most of the time. Forcing someone to sacrifice themselves to lightning to activate reproductive spores with the electrical current? Sure, that's in their capability. Forcibly creating a culture of forced transmission among humans? A bit more of a stretch. Even if they all were infected, however, it's clearly not overwhelming- they can still resist its commands enough to not just immediately jump in the lightning, and if Svir and Lindon are infected, well, they clearly can live moderately normal lives, so it's not exactly zombification, is it?

The second, and more important, reason that I don't think the (still hypothetical) lightning fungus parasite is a threat to civilization? 

Because that would run counter to every theme of the series itself. To have the Masquerade be RIGHT about its inherent distrust and hate of other cultures, its inability to accept other ways of life? It would be a violation of every promise the series has made so far. Dickinson even explicitly described the lightning people as a ""way of life"" in his afterword- this is a living culture, even if it's a psychedelically weird one. The Baru Cormorant books are one of the most brilliant, thoughtful, and thought-provoking meditations on the evils of colonialism I've ever encountered, and to devolve into simple zombie nonsense? Zombies, the most literal metaphor for xenophobia in the horror trope palette? Absolutely not going to happen. 

No, the evil is going to be inflicted on the lightning people by the Masquerade. They're going to try to end the lightning ritual, just as colonial powers have oh-so-often throughout history tried to end and destroy cultural rituals, and even entire cultures, that they don't understand. The lightning continent might very well be the Americas for Baru Cormorant's world, and we might be about to see the Masquerade bring genocide there, see a horrific equivalent of the mass plagues of the Columbian exchange, which wiped out 90% of the population of the Americas.

Or, at least, the Masquerade is going to *try* to destroy the lightning people. I, for one, would be supremely delighted if they found they'd bitten off more than they could chew.

Maybe I'm wrong about the parasitic fungus. It could be something totally different- electromagnetic dybbuks or something. In the end, though, regardless whether I'm right about the lightning activated brain parasite fungus or not, I am so, so happy to have gotten the chance to theorize about what's going on, and to dive into actual scientific explanations for fantasy world phenomena. Getting to theorize like this is one of my greatest joys as a reader, and it's one of the biggest reasons I'm such a fanboy of Baru Cormorant."

655,Fantasy,Feeling utterly depressed after finishing Sword of Kaigen,"I finished Sword of Kaigen two days ago, and I loved it for a lot of the same reasons that everyone else on this sub does. I don't want to retread those reasons, but Misaki's character was pleasantly fresh, and &gt;!Takeru's character arc !&lt;was particularly satisfying.

That being said, this book broke me in a way that I haven't felt in a long time. The first bout of depression came after &gt;!Mamoru's death!&lt;, an event so tragic that I stopped reading for about a week to maintain my own headcanon of &gt;!him somehow still being alive!&lt;. Still, eventually I had to leave that headcanon behind and read the story as ML Wang intended it, and it was beautiful. Truly beautiful.

The second bout of depression came after finishing the story. I can't explain why, because there was a consistent throughline of *hope* in the final chapters. The book tied up every loose thread, and despite the tragic events that occurred during the battle, I felt proud of these characters and their growth.

I think what I'm feeling is a combination of post-book depression and reflecting on the tragedy of the story. I am utterly destroyed by the fact that I won't know more of this family's story.  And I'm also quite sad that it will be a while before I find another book that affects me to this degree.

Did anyone else feel this way? I'm not sure why I felt compelled to make this post, I think I just need to talk to someone about this story."
656,Fantasy,Soulsborne-like Novels - What makes them so?,"I see a lot of and have asked for soulsborne-like novel recommendations before. However, I’ve never read one that quite satisfies that need. (Maybe Books of the New Sun do, but I couldn’t get past the first 50 pages due to all the misogyny.) The most recent example was someone on the Bloodborne sub recommending Piranesi, by Susanna Clarke, saying it’s a novel about scholars exploring a labyrinthine place, attaining forbidden knowledge and going mad while doing it, citing it as similar to the Chalice Dungeons. Yet, the official synopsis paints quite a different narrative. I’ll still be checking it out, because it sounds interesting, but just not… Soulsborne-y.

So that led me to wonder: what exactly would make a novel soulsborne-y enough, to me? Is it the same things that other people value in the franchise’s narrative? How do these different views lead to such different recommendations? Below, I’ll outline my specific preferences and sine qua non’s that would make a novel soulsborne-like.

**Genre:** Dark Fantasy is a given. My preferences tend to lean towards Horror more than Epic Fantasy, so more on that side of the scale. I don’t think the Soulsborne series is particularly Grimdark, either. The state of things tends to be absolutely awful, yes, but there’s a slight hint of beauty and hope in all the IPs that pull it away from that genre. Lastly, despite them being \*action\* RPGs, I don’t think Action / Adventure in terms of break-neck pace and conflict would befit a soulsborne novel. Mystery as a subgenre would be much better.

**Setting:** Gothic; either in the medieval gothic sense or in the victorian gothic sense. Each of these would lead to very different stories, for sure, but I find both absolutely acceptable. It would also have to be a “cold, dark and very gentle place”, to borrow the painter’s words. Bright worlds full of life won’t do.

**Narrative:** Something very specific to the Soulsborne narrative that most authors don’t like to do is leave things unexplained. I’m not sure whether this stems from a want to showcase all the cool worldbuilding they’ve done or fear of confusing the reader or both, but it seems to be mostly a western commercial Fantasy thing. Most manga, for example, will drop you into stories and not explain the vast majority of plot points until the very last arc and it does so unapologetically. It makes for much more satisfying twists and it leaves much more space for speculation and theories which, even if they turn out to be wrong, engage the reader. I’d like to see more of that, rather than having my hand held throughout the entirety of the novel or having three neon arrows pointing at the same bit of foreshadowing.

**Characters:** I left this one for last, as it’s probably the trickiest. The Soulsborne protagonists are blank slates because they have to be so the player can have the freedom to create their own character to project onto them. This, of course, doesn’t work in novels. I guess to have a truly Soulsborne-like novel we’d have to have a lone-wolf that starts from nothing and makes their way onto great power. Personally, however, this is the point where I digress the most from the series. I prefer groups, as I tend to get bored of following just one person for too long periods of time (fine for just one novel; not so fine for a trilogy or a seven book series).

Looking at all of it laid down like this, I feel like the narrative part is probably the hardest to pull off. That and the fact that most Fantasy novels focus on Action / Adventure rather than Mystery or Exploration / Discovery are, most likely, the main reasons why I haven’t yet found anything to satisfy my need for Soulsborne novels. 

What about you? Have you found the “perfect” Soulsborne novel? Does it fit all these prerequisites or others you value more? What are they?

Also, if you have any recs that fit the above criteria, please drop them here!"
657,Fantasy,"Xanth, Enchanted Forest, other fantasy series that modern fantasy needs to learn from","I have been feeling really disillusioned with reading every since the era of Dusk, Game of Chairs, and somewhere between 48 and 52 shades of black. The world of modern fantasy  became dark, boring, predictable, and dumbed down for the mass audiences.

Its been many years since I really picked up and completed a book, especially in the fantasy genre. But after recently uncovering my Xanth collection I feel excited once again for an actual fantasy world that isnt a bog standard Tolkien-fantasy or more grimdark depressing Goat-alikes.

I highly recommend the first three novels in the series, ""A Spell for Chameleon"", ""The Source of Magic"", and ""Castle Roogna"". There is something about the way the world is written that really makes it enchanting, which is sure to drag most readers deep into the series. I think even the most bitter redditor could learn something from these books. I attempted to post about this in /r/books but apparently there are desperate Morality-scolds refreshing the page every half second, ready to trash and downvote anything they can google.

Reading these older fantasy series has reignited my love of the genre and I've taken to finalizing the creation of my own fantasy setting. I've started reading pretty heavily in the Enchanted Forest series by Patricia Wrede, the Broken Sky series,which is eerily reminiscent of a proto-Avatar The Last Airbender world, and the Circle of Magic series by Tamora Pierce."
658,Fantasy,Book with dinosaurs that isn’t Jurassic Park.,My husband &amp; I were discussing books &amp; he mentioned that there was a book series he kept seeing advertised on either Facebook or Reddit that had dinosaurs. He remembers that it had dinosaurs &amp; that he seems to remember that the military were either fighting the dinosaurs or teaming up with them to fight something else. Does anyone know what this could be? I would love to help him find whatever it is.
659,Fantasy,A Little Trope I'm Tired of Seeing,"This isn't so much of a rant as a warning for aspiring writers and a hopeful call for solidarity among *other* longtime fantasy fans tired of this trope, too.

I'm tired of the trope of male-written fantasy series with too many female characters whose entire arcs are ""Wow... maybe it's actually *okay* to feminine and tough :))."" It's such a boring outdated conflict. When the only women characters who *aren't* like that are shallow two-dimensional ""eats meat raw"" type women characters, you have fantasy fans go ""Well I'd rather have the *nuanced arc* than that—"" just write more different characters! I have no idea what women these authors are hanging around with. I live in the city—everyone just wears pants and joggers. It's been like that for decades. 

For the inspiring author that's inevitably hurts because they have plotted a character like that: think about *why* you're writing it. I think a lot of authors just write it because they're like ""Oh, this is the way people write women characters!"" My favorite piece of advice that I've heard for fantasy writers is to think about *why* you're including a given thing—why are you including a system that's so aligned with 20th-century western debates in your story about magic swords and spells? Often writes will include a trope without thinking of a reason, thereby unintentionally having ascribed to it the default reason of ""it's just the way things are done."" Authors write these stories about women who are badass and wearing dresses like it's violating some status quo, when in reality they're piling on examples of support in an outdated mode. 

Please, just write more kinds of women. Talk to women."
660,Fantasy,"Malazan/Deadhouse Gates, two thirds of the way through. Losing the will to live -- convince me to finish the book.","Listening to Deadhouse Gates now for about six months. I really enjoyed *Gardens of the Moon*, and since I heard that that wasn't the best-written book, I was eager to start on the rest of the series. However, I've ended up mired in DHG for six months -- partly because other books have held my interest for longer and I've finished half a dozen while listening to DHG, and partly because I've just been too knackered by working through the pandemic to read anything. So I thought I'd get back on with it now spring has come and I can resume walking to and from work.

Instead I have quite literally lost the plot. I did get interested when Felisin and co were escaping from Otataral Island and on their yomp across the desert. I then got to the point where I was just screening out what was going on. It just doesn't seem to hold my attention.

But I know that the next book brings all my favourite characters back and that I've heard you can read MoI without necessarily having finished DHG. As long as Kruppe is there things go quicker.

So should I (a) press on with MoI (b) finish DHG or (c) just admit Malazan is too much for me to handle RN. I've been reading a lot of literary books where the characters come to life a lot more and I do think GotM was well-written, but DHG just feels turgid and I'm just not invested in it?

Or is there a plan (d)?!"
661,Fantasy,Will Wight's The Traveller's Gate Trilogy for free on Amazon,
662,Fantasy,The Immortal Hulk,"I'd heard about the series last year but only got around to reading it this weekend. I'm a pretty big Hulk fan. Planet/World War Hulk is still one of my favorite arcs I've ever read. So if you take Hulk and you plant him in a psychadelic sci-fi horror adventure combo, hoo boy, I am probably gonna like it.

And HOO BOY, I *FUCKING* love this series. For those who haven't heard of it, the basic conceit that Banner figured something out not long ago. He's effectively immortal. Like, Bruce Banner can die...but it don't stick. The Hulk we know, the ""Hulk strongest there is!"" Hulk isn't around and instead, Banner's in full nomad mode with a smart, vicious Hulk coming out at night, especially if Banner's been killed. This Hulk isn't evil though. He's just...mad.

And that's where the series gets interesting. Because you got your body horror (oh boy, do you ever get body horror), you get your existential ""who am I"" questions, you get your action, you get BUCKETS of gore, and you get some trippy cosmic concepts. You also get blatant anticapitalist messages. The new Hulk, well, see, he's kind of pissed off because the world's going to shit REAL fast and it's all because the systems we have in place make it nearly impossible to change. This Hulk series mirrors the very real, very *present* problems of our world. And Hulk's plan is to effectively end the world as we know it. To ""smash what needs to be smashed"".

The series dives into aspects of mental health, speaks on Dissociative Identity Disorder in a crude but accurate way, and Hulk even says Trans Rights, baybeeeeeee! There are some panels in this series where I'm just like, ""Stop! I can only get so turned on!""

Anyone else read it? Your thoughts?"
663,Fantasy,"A Hobbit, a Wardrobe, and a Great War by Joseph Loconte - any opinions?","I am generally skeptical of books that try to enter the mind of an author, and even more so if that author is Tolkien. I read various comments about this book - [A Hobbit, a Wardrobe, and a Great War: How J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis Rediscovered Faith, Friendship, and Heroism in the Cataclysm of 1914-18](https://www.amazon.com/Hobbit-Wardrobe-Great-War-Rediscovered-ebook/dp/B00PWOH1EM/) \- and some are very laudatory, while others are totally on the other pole. 

Generally speaking, the author places the lives of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis in the context of the First World War and how this affected their work. The book is also about the friendship between them.   


Have any of you read the book and would you recommend it?"
664,Fantasy,The wish-fulfillment main character ruins stories (rant),"You know which one; young teen with bland personality and appearance discovers he/she is special and has everyone love him or praise him and the there's two love interests just for fun. Struggle is good! You need characters who are lost and have no clue how to get ahead, not a protagonist that's just naturally good at everything and everyone loves right off the bat."
665,Fantasy,+1 for Dragon Mage by ML Spencer,"Thanks to the recent review by u/CT_Phipps, I picked up Dragon Mage by ML Spencer ( u/MLSpencer1).  I absolutely loved it! 

I found in it echoes of early Feist, in the coming-of-age tale of two very different boys into magical power. I also found wonderful echoes of Dragonriders of Pern in the handling of dragons and their relationships with their riders. It's really a return to much of the high fantasy I grew up on.

That's not to say that this is a knockoff by any means; Spencer tells a new story with a new and interesting protagonist, a novel magic system, and a unique, fleshed-out world.  

Spencer embraces diversity across multiple dimensions of her characters, not the least of which is a protagonist who, in today's world, would probably be classified as being somewhere on the autism spectrum.  Many of the critical reviews of the book (of which there really aren't many) seem to be from folk who can't relate to this or find it off-putting.  I found the character very relatable, and his weaknesses set this novel apart from ""farm boy gets powers, saves world, gets girl, has breakfast"" tropes. There's perhaps a little flavor of LeGuin in how these characters are handled.

Dragon Mage is a whopper of a book, at nearly 1,000 pages. However, not once did I find a break in pacing or any part of the book to be a slog. Quite the opposite, I found it to be quite a page-turner throughout. 

I found Spencer's writing to be crisp and approachable, with a nice balance of description, exposition, and action. 

So many times these days we find a first book in a series to be full of backstory and stage-setting for a 10-book series, that it was refreshing to find a novel in which the author clearly wanted to tell the story in one go.  I believe there will be a sequel, but Dragon Mage is a standalone story that, while it leaves a couple of minor threads hanging (which I got RAFO'd on), leaves the reader at a satisfactory point at the end.

I cannot recommend this book highly enough!  I have also picked up some of Spencer's earlier works, which are classified as more ""grimdark"" -- which is not usually my thing, but I'll report back on that at a later date."

674,Fantasy,"I've just finished The Dragon Waiting, and I have some thoughts...","I've just finished The Dragon Waiting, and wow, what a book. For those who don't know, this much-praised fantasy book has been long out of print, and Tor has recently revived it. Gene Wolfe spoke highly of it, and that's endorsement enough for me. Now though, I have a few thoughts and more than a few questions for anyone who can answer them.

The first section was really compelling. It felt like reading the backstory for a party of D&amp;D characters. The Welsh boy who meets a down-on-his-luck wizard and will do anything to become his novitiate! The Greek son of the governor of Gaul, exiled to the far reaches of the Byzantine Empire to keep them far from the throne! The young Italian doctor to the Medicis, who becomes involved in cloak and dagger politics! I was so excited for these people to meet. They all had a reason to hate the empire, a place talked about in acidic tones but not yet seen.

And what a strange place this Byzantine Empire must be. Quirks of fate-- &gt;!Julius Caesar's loss to Vercingetorix, the extended rule of Julian the Apostate, rulers who extend their reign through vampirism!&lt; --lead to a world where a true Second Rome can bloom. And at its heart, Byzantium, a place grander and stranger than any other place in history! The scene was set for a truly fascinating world that I could not wait to explore.

My appetite was whet for the meeting of the exiled prince, the roguish healer, and the ill-fated boy wizard, and for them to take off on a roaring adventure to stab at the heart of the empire!

Unfortunately, that is not at all what happens.

Instead, in the 2nd and 3rd acts of the book, things veer away in the opposite direction. They do meet, but it isn't gratifying.  &gt;!With little explanation, they soon set off for a (barely) alternate Britain, an altogether less interesting place. Britain has more gods but is otherwise the place we have in our historical imaginations.!&lt;  The plot-- &gt;!oh yay another succession war!&lt;--is supremely uninteresting compared to the story the first third hints at.

Worse, the author shifts styles. We get very little interior monologue or narrative description. Characters rarely say what they think or intend. Once you've finished, you feel like you've watched parts of a movie through a neighbors window. You recognize a few faces, can see that fights and arguments are taking place, but you don't get much in the way of characterization, plot, or worldbuilding.

So here's what my questions amount to: What the hell happened?

I'm not stupid. I read some pretty difficult and cryptic books for fun, and I'm not going to pretend the emperor has clothes. Gene Wolfe, for example, wrote books that might take a few reads to really understand, but you'd get the general shape of the thing on the first pass and you could tell that the pieces were there if you wanted to look for them. The Dragon Waiting made me feel like I'd need to hunt for double-meanings and fingerprints just to figure out what they had for dinner. Knowing looks and swallowed sentences keep anyone from actually saying anything.

I mean this earnestly, what am I missing? What did any of the characters want? What was actually happening between any of them? The vampire, the wizard, the doctor, and the mercenary were all clearly going through their own personal, psychological journeys, but I'm not at all clear what they were.

Also, does anyone want to disagree with me? Is this a masterpiece that I just don't appreciate?

In closing, if someone ever takes the first third of this book and writes a new middle and ending, I'd be very excited to read it."
675,Fantasy,Wrapping Up My First Year of Book Bingo,"The Christmas before Kindle my parents got me a Kindle, talk about perfect timing. I’d read a lot growin gup, but had tailed off a bit in college and never picked it back up to the same extent until getting the Kindle. Then I started tearing through books again.

I figured out what Bingo was in March, and I thought it seemed like a wonderful ~~way to get a flair to show off~~ challenge. So I dove right in once the new card started in April.

Overall for I read seventy-five speculative fiction books during this Bingo cycle, including quite a few highly regarded books as I catch up on what I’ve been missing out on over the years. And I fit as many of my favorites onto the the card as I could. So…ratings tend to be rather high.

**Translated:** Amatka by Karin Tidbeck

This was a rather intriguing bit of dystopian sci fi. Amatka is a city in a world that humanity came to, at some point. It’s not entirely clear how, nor is it important to a story. What is important is that in this world an object’s physical form is, in part, defined by what it’s called. If it’s not named often enough it can dissolve into a goo-like substance. And there are hints early on in the novel that this property of the world has caused issues in the past. In any case, Amatka covers a lot of the themes you’d expect from a dystopian novel, with the importance of naming/identity adding an interesting layer to things as even language “needs” to be regulated to keep society safe. It all adds up to be both an interesting and disquieting read.

**Features Snow, Ice, or Cold:** The Wolf in the Whale by Jordanna Max Brodsky

For me, this book was one of those occasions where you stumble across it in a bookstore and just know you need to read it. I don’t think we see nearly enough fantasy settings based off of pre-Columbian North America, and Norse Mythology has fascinated me for close to two decades now. Take a book that prominently features both and add on a perfect cover…it catches my attention. I felt the world was portrayed very well. And Omat’s struggle with gender identity seemed very thoughtfully and capably expressed. At least as far as I could tell from a straight, male perspective. I also felt that both Norse and Inuit mythology was folded wonderfully into the story. Sometimes in ways that I saw coming, sometimes in ways that caught me off guard, but always in a way that managed to feel true both mythologies. In the end the book didn’t quite meet my expectations, but that’s more because they were sky high than any shortcomings to be found in the book itself.

**Optimistic:** The Burning White by Brent Weeks

Based off what I’ve seen people saying about this book, I’d say it’s probably the most polarizing entry on my bingo card. I’ve seen people say that it grows suddenly too religious, that it veers too far into deus ex machina, and that it panders to reading with an overly happy ending. And while I can see where a lot of these complaints come from, I think they’re by and large overblown. Religion was a central theme in the series from the beginning, so the way it’s handled here doesn’t seem out of place at all. I think it’s more that some people thought it was going to be handled in a different way than it was. The ending could get a bit saccharine sweet at times and there was an incident or two of deus ex machina. But that was all something that felt more annoying than story-ruining to me. I actually took more issue with how there were a few story-lines that just seemed to get dropped and/or have no real impact. But all in all it was still a very enjoyable book, and there were some four to five hundred pages where I had trouble putting it down because I needed to see what happened. I’m willing to forgive a lot of flaws if a book can draw me in for that long, and I’m not even sure I’d go so far as to say there are a lot of flaws in this one. So while this doesn’t quite measure up to the heights that Lightbringer reached in books 2 and 3, while it may not quite stick the landing perfectly, it’s still a worthy conclusion to a very enjoyable series.

**Features Necromancy:** Harrow the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir

I feel like Muir took a big risk with this book, and it paid off wonderfully. She hit on a very successful formula with the first book, and then took this one in a completely different direction. The irreverent snark that dominated the tone of Gideon the Ninth is replaced by something altogether darker, more uncertain, and more disturbing. The story unfolded in a way that had me questioning what I’d read in the first book; had I missed something important, misunderstood something, was what was written previously really what had happened? Really, the most succinct description I could give of Harrow the Ninth is that it’s a beautifully twisted mindfuck. And, of course, simply confusing a reader isn’t terribly difficult in and of itself. That’s easy to do with a poorly-written book. The incredible thing about Harrow the Ninth is that it manages to make a reader hopelessly confused for about the first two-thirds of the book or so…and then tie it all back together in a way that makes perfect sense and is deeply satisfying. The way it was pull off was, to me, nothing less than stunning. And it firmly established Tamsyn Muir as a must-buy author for me going forward.

Rating: 10/10

**Ace/Aro:** The Raven Tower by Ann Leckie

Slotting The Raven Tower in here might be slightly controversial. No character is explicitly declared to be ace/aro in the book itself. Nor, to my knowledge, has it been declared by word of god. The stone god does, however, repeatedly mention how he has no wish to take on an organic form (even though he could) because he doesn’t want to deal with all the various things that having one entails. And I personally find that to be a pretty strong indication that he has no interest in sex. But in any case, this was an absolutely delightful novel that follows two storylines. The first is a relatively basic succession crisis, after the leader of a settlement dies mysteriously and his brother takes power before the son and heir returns. Then there’s the one I found far more fascinating, where a Stone God regales us with his story from time immemorial to the present day. And it is wonderful. From the wisdom he dispenses to the care with which his magic forces him to speak I loved everything about his story. Eventually the two storylines converge upon one another to add up to a wonderful novel. Hearing that Ann Leckie turned down a Hugo nomination for it made a lot of sense to me, because before that I’d had trouble imagining how it had missed the cut.

**Features a Ghost:** Things in Jars by Jess Kidd	

This is an interesting book to try and rate. Some characters are fascinating, while others fall a bit flat. And oftentimes it feels that the plot is moving the character instead of being driven by them, which I’m rarely fond of. And the setting isn’t quite as fantastically weird as I was lead to believe from the descriptions I’ve seen of the book. But on the other hand, the prose can be absolutely beautiful at places. Especially some of what we see from the ghost, who I’d say is probably the second most prominent character in the novel. And even more impressive than that was how Victorian era London was portrayed. I’ve read a lot of books, and seen a lot of movies/shows, in that setting. But I don’t think I’ve ever come across another that immerses you in it so completely. Ultimately I can see why a lot of people might not like this one, especially if they place a premium on how well-crafted the plot is. But if you’re the kind of person who can lose yourself in prose and a setting it’s probably a book you’d enjoy. It was enough for me to consider it a good read.

**Exploration:** Into the Drowning Deep by Mira Grant

This was my first book by Seanan McGuire or any of the other names she publishes books under (I think she’s at three now), and it was a treat. Essentially a boat disappeared some years ago near the Mariana Trench, and now a research expedition is being sent out to explore the trench and figure out what happened. The rising action is laced through with mounting dread, and there are several moments of pulse-pounding fear once the climax hits. It hit all the notes I hoped to find in a horror novel, drawing on the unfathomable mysteries of the deep ocean to do it. And if that’s not enough the book is saturated with a constant commentary about science and how scientists view the world. As a biochemist myself, I thought that aspect was incredibly well-done. And all told everything blended together into a wonderful reading experience.

Rating: 9.5/10

**Climate Fiction:** Holy Sister by Mark Lawrence

I read the entirety of the Book of the Ancestor this Bingo Cycle, and loved every one of them. The characters and the setting both fascinated me. As did the prose. It feels like Mark Lawrence has a way of writing long stretches of prose that’s “merely” good, and then just dropping a line that blows you away. I love the effect. Holy Sister is the book I used for bingo here because it’s where the climate feels like it has the most pronounced effect. Where the squeeze that the narrowing habitable band puts on the world really reaches its boiling point. And then we get to see how these young women we’ve seen grow up before our eyes handle it.  True to form they meet it unflinchingly, fearlessly, and without compromising themselves or their values. Holy Sister is an incredible book to conclude an incredible series, it pulls you in from the first page and doesn’t let you go until the last. I can’t recommend the book, or the series, enough.

Rating: 10/10

**Color in Title:** The Empire of Gold by S.A. Chakraborty

I thought that The City of Brass was a good book, The Kingdom of Copper was a great one. And Empire of Gold is transcendent. The shortcomings and rough edges that I thought were present to some extent in the earlier novels feel that they’re gone now, filed away as Chakraborty hones her craft with each release. Perhaps even more importantly we get to see the supernatural world open up. We finally get to see a lot more of what lies beyond Daevabad, and how that mythical city fits into the broader supernatural landscape. And the trilogy is so much richer for it. While the book is, perhaps, a bit slow at the beginning I don’t think it’s a flaw. Chakraborty isn’t spinning her wheels at the beginning of the novel. Rather, she’s making sure everything is set perfectly into position. And there’s a lot for her to move into place. But once it’s all there, the finale unfolds beautifully. I can’t think of a single storyline or character arc that wasn’t wrapped up in a satisfying manner. Chakraborty absolutely nailed the landing with Empire of Gold, and I can’t wait to see what she writes next.

Rating: 10/10

**Book Club:** Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky

Never did I think anything could ever make me love reading about spiders as much as this book. In Children of Time we follow two distinct, but intertwined storylines. One follows a ship full of humans, fleeing a poisoned Earth and seeking a new home so their species can survive. It’s well done, but it’s the other storyline where this book really shines. In that one we follow a sentient spider society. We see several of the most significant events of its history, and how it evolves over time. It’s a society that is at once both familiar and alien. More importantly, it’s utterly fascinating. If the spider society was the entire book it would probably still be a five star read. But seeing how it compared and contrasts with the humans added another lair. Both societies are fascinating counterpoints to one another as their paths move to both converge and diverge. Until, ultimately, a wonderfully fitting climax is reached.

**Self-Published:** The Korinniad by A.K. Caggiano

Here we meet Korinna, a young Greek girl slated to be her community’s next human sacrifice. Korinna would prefer not to be sacrificed. And figures that the best way to avoid this fate is to, well, not be a virgin. Thankfully for her, Aphrodite is scheming and has put Korinna at the center of a competition between the gods…hijinx ensue. Essentially, The Korinniad is a rom-com set in mythological Greece. If you like rom-coms you’ll probably like this book, if they aren’t for you The Korinniad probably won’t be either. Personally I’m not a big rom-com fan, and the humor veered a bit too far towards the absurdist for my take at times. So I considered it to be an average book. It didn’t appeal to me too much, but there were no gaping flaws in it either. But as I touched on earlier, that’s because rom-coms aren’t my thing. If you enjoy them then by all means give this book a shot.

**Chapter Epigraphs:** A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine

This book, in lesser hands, could easily have been a fairly unremarkable political murder-mystery set in space. But Arkady Martine wove this story so masterfully that it’s status as a debut novel defies belief. I don’t think I’ve ever read another book where every last word felt so deliberately and perfectly chosen. Or one where I was so certain that I’d need a re-read to pick up on everything that happened (and since I can hardly wait to read A Desolation Called Peace that re-read will probably come soon). All this combines with wonderful character work and beautiful commentary on empires and colonialism to result in an extraordinary work. I read four of the Hugo finalists for best novel last year. I gave all four of them five stars on Goodreads, they were all fantastic. And I still don’t have any doubts that A Memory Called Empire deserved to win, it’s just that good.

Rating: 10/10

**Published in 2020:** The Bone Shard daughter by Andrea Stewart

Andrea Stewart’s debut novel begins with, “Father told me I’m broken.” So we know right from the beginning that she can catch our attention. By and large, she knows how to keep it too. We follow five POV characters through a fascinating archipelago of moving islands. Two of them, a mid-level noble daughter and her impoverished lover, lead to a storyline that felt fairly predictable and unremarkable. But we didn’t see too much of them so it’s hard to mind too much. The third, also a more minor POV, is wrapped in mystery and leaves you guessing as to just what’s going on in the world. The other two, a smuggler and the Empire’s titular daughter, make for a great read. We get to see the Empire’s daughter grapple with doubt, but never shy away from a challenge in her determination to prove herself to her father. We get to see the smuggler get drawn out of his selfish shell with the help of an absolutely adorable animal companion. And all along the way we get to watch the story lay itself out beautifully. Stewart does an especially impressive job of hinting at what’s still going on, while still leaving it just vague enough to still leave us surprised when the reveals come. It’s a great work. And though this debut does still have a few rough edges it also leaves me fully confident they’ll disappear as Andrea Stewart continues to write and hone her craft. It feels like she’s at about the same stage here as Chakraborty was when she wrote The City of Brass, and that’s a very good place to be.

**Set in a School/University:** The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang

The Poppy War is a brutally impressive debut. We meet Rin, an orphaned peasant who’s determined to make herself into something more than some man’s meek wife. Luckily for her she has the intelligence, and, more importantly, the sheer single-minded determination needed to do just that. She gains entrance to the most prestigious school in the land, finds herself launched into a terrible war, and draws the eye of a god who wants nothing more than to watch the world burn. It’s a breathtaking, fast-paced, and absolutely brutal read. This is a book that does not shy away from portraying the horrors of war, not for an instant. So at times it certainly isn’t an easy read. But it’s always a great one.

**Book about Books:** The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alex E. Harrow

The first thing that hit me when I read this book was the prose. There’s an effortless lyricism to Harrow’s writing that I haven’t seen since Rothfuss, and I loved it. The rest of the book doesn’t disappoint either. Perhaps the characters and plot are a touch on the simpler side. But this is a book that seems to be written to have a fairy-tale kind of feel, so the simplicity fits well. It’s also a love letter, to stories and story-telling. All in all the book is enchanting, a delight to experience, and an absolute joy to read.

Rating: 9.5/10

**Made You Laugh:** Kings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames

Bingo did help me realize that I laugh during a lot more books than I ever realized I did. Of course, most of those books just give me an isolated chuckle every now and then. Kings of the Wyld did a lot more than that. It was easily the funniest book I’ve read this year, frequently making me laugh out loud. And the humor alone would make this a good book, as a group of aging adventurers get back together for one last hurrah. But the book also has so much depth to it. The tone can whiplash between uproariously hilarious and deeply profound faster than anything has any right to. And it does so with a seamlessness that defies belief. It’s a triumph of storytelling, and I’m deeply grateful to this subreddit for singing its praises over and over again until I simply had to give it a try.

Rating: 10/10

**Short Stories:** Dreamsongs Volume 1 by George R.R. Martin

This is a collection of short stories from all throughout Martin’s life, starting when he was a teenager. So as you might expect, the quality of the stories are a bit mixed. Even as accomplished an author as he is had a lot of room for growth as a teenager. But though some of the stories have rough edges, and some aren’t to my taste, many were incredible. There are Hugo winners in these pages after all. There’s also more to this anthology than just the stories. The book is broken into sections, featuring stories from a certain time in Martin’s life or stories that fall under a certain genre. And at the beginning of every section Martin also provides a commentary. He talks about what his life was like at the time, what inspired him to write these stories, his attempts to get them published, and the like. It’s a fascinating look into both his life and the way that speculative fiction has evolved through the years. And altogether it makes for a rather rewarding read.

Rating: 8/10

**Big Dumb Object:** The Obelisk Gate by N.K. Jemisin

I read a lot of books over the past year or so. Many of them were excellent. But the Broken Earth Trilogy is hands down my favorite. You can see where N.K. Jemisin’s experiences as a woman of color bleed over into her storytelling all throughout this trilogy. It makes for an incredibly powerful story; and the best fictional examination of slavery, prejudice, and discrimination that I’ve ever come across. It’s an utter triumph of storytelling that immediately propelled Jemisin to the top of my list of favorite authors. There’s not a single aspect of any of the three books that I’d change. I chose The Obelisk Gate for my card, out of the three because I’d read The Fifth Season back in January. And because this is the one where the mystery of the floating, crystalline obelisks that float through the skies seems most central to the book.

Rating: 10/10
	
**Feminist:** The Sword of Kaigen by M.L. Wang

I once saw this described as “the most imperfect perfect book.” And that description just fits so well. There are definitely some aspects of the book that don’t quite work. The setting feels incongruous at times, and the tie-in with the Theonite series just seems out of place in the narrative. But the complaints are completely overshadowed by things done exceptionally well. The magic system is reminiscent of Avatar. Combine that with the way Wang’s background as a martial artist can shine through and you get incredible fight scenes. The character work is top notch. And the story has an exquisitely crafted dual-climax structure, with each climax breaking your heart in completely different ways. This book is just an achingly beautiful experience, fully deserving of its SPFBO victory. And I’m very much looking forward to seeing what M.L. Wang does going forward in fresh settings.

Rating: 9.5/10

**Canadian Author:** End of the Wild by Jason Taylor

This book was a bit of a disappointment. The back cover made me think we were getting a deep, atmospheric horror influenced by the folklore of the Pacific Northwest. There was a bit of that, and it was even well-done, but we moved past it quickly. Instead we just got two characters who felt as though they were being moved by the plot instead of having their own agency. Even more troubling the story smacks of the white savior trope. It was still written decently enough, which keeps me from considering it a below-average book. But I don’t think it’s one I’d recommend to anybody.

Rating: 5/10 rounded up to 3 stars on Goodreads

**Number in the Title:** Seven Blades in Black by Sam Sykes

If revelations about the author’s past behavior had come out before I picked up this book I’d have never bought it. If I’d read any other books that fit hard mode for this square it wouldn’t be on my Bingo Card. And that’s all I have to say about this one.

**Romance:** Empire of Sand by Tasha Suri

This one falls under the category of a very well-written book that wasn’t quite to my taste. I loved the setting. Tasha Suri’s re-imagining of India is simply enchanting. I was impressed by her characters too, and loved reading about the clash of cultures. Ultimately the one thing that kept me from getting too far into this book is that romance was the central pillar of the story, whereas I generally prefer it to be more of a supporting one. But I do think it’s a great read for anyone more inclined towards reading romance-heavy novels than I am. And I’m eagerly looking forward to the release of The Jasmine Throne, which seems like it’ll be a bit more of a stylistic match for me.

Rating: 8/10	

**Magical Pet:** The Secret Commonwealth by Phillip Pullman

His Dark Materials is my favorite young adult series. And there’s nothing I’ve read about in any fantasy novel that I’ve wished I could have more than a dæmon. So I had to put Pullman’s latest work set in Lyra’s world in this spot. This book doesn’t quite live up to the magic of the previous trilogy for me. The wide-eyed wonder that Lyra once saw the world through is gone here, and there’s not quite as much human-dæmon interaction as I’d hoped for. But that definitely seems to be a conscious decision on Pullman’s part to build towards book three of this trilogy than any oversight on his part, and I have faith in him to see it through. Honestly the main complaint I have here is that there’s some middle-book syndrome present in this way. It seems a bit more focused on building towards the third book than standing on its own. But despite that, it’s hard to see myself not enjoying a book written by Pullman and set in Lyra’s world. And it was nice learning a bit more about some of the supernatural aspects of the world mentioned in previous books. So this was certainly a solidly enjoyable read for me, if not quite a spectacular one.

Rating: 7.5/10

**Graphic/Audio Novel:** Snow, Glass, Apples written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Colleen Doran

Gaiman works his magic here with a haunting retelling of Snow White, beautifully illustrated by Colleen Doran. Just, as a word of warning, be careful showing this one to kids. Some of the illustrations are a bit more suggestive than I expected going in. And while not in bad taste, by any means, it’s definitely not something I’d want to show young children. But aside from that the only complaint I can make is that it ended too soon. I loved Gaiman’s darker take on the tale. And Doran’s illustrations, aside from being beautiful in their own right, are just stylistically perfect for the tone Gaiman uses. As quick of a read as this is, everyone who gets the chance to pick it up should experience it.

**Features Politics:** Jade City by Fonda Lee

I did not know how much I needed an Asian-inspired mob book drawing influence on from numerous different crime syndicates around the world until I picked up this book. And man it was a treat. Fonda Lee immerses us in the city of Janloon; the sticky heat of monsoon season, the local cuisine, the bustle and press of the streets. And you grow to love the characters whose eyes she reveals her world to you through. Perhaps they aren’t quite good people, but they are deeply compelling. And the story, it really does just draw you in. Fonda Lee demonstrates an ability to blindside you with plot developments that ensure you need to see what comes next. And the exquisitely-written fight scenes that are interspersed with all the high-stakes political maneuvering keep your attention as well. This is another case of an author’s martial arts experience shining through in the fight scenes. This one was a deep, white-knuckled thrill ride that left me guessing until the end.

681,Fantasy,I need help finding a book to read. (Recommendation),"Hi,

I have been a fan of the fantasy genre for a long time. I love fantasy themed video games, card games, movies. However, I'm not much of a reader. Whilst I love the idea of getting lost in an epic fantasy series, in practice I find it hard to finish books.

I am looking for a recommendation to bring me into the world of fantasy literature.

Ideally, I would like something that is well rounded and gives me everything a good fantasy story should have. I don't mind tropes and cliches at all because I probably wouldn't even notice them! I would like the book to be well paced and gripping to give me the best chance of finishing it. I also would like for it to deal with some darker, grittier and macabre themes if possible. 

I'm thinking a self contained story would be best so that I can focus on actually finishing it, but I'm open to a series if you think I would like it.

Finally, I do have ""The Name of the Wind"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" on my bookshelf but I'm yet to start any of these, could they be a good start?

Thanks all."
682,Fantasy,Reviewing everything I read - March part I - Lot's of sequels,"Here we go again with another half-month - you'll notice that almost all my reading in March was via audio, that because the new semester had began for me and the first few weels of a semester are the busiest for me so Im hoping to get back to physically reading in the coming weeks (also Im in the middle of Dragon Mage and that a thick book). 

One of my yearly decisions was to review everything I read here so if you want previous months - 

[February 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ljmarz/minirveiew_of_what_ive_read_in_february_so_far/), [February 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ly8xbl/reviewing_everything_ive_read_in_february_part_ii/) and [January (comment)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/l9ctr1/january_reading_list_i_share_mine_you_share_yours/glhxax7/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). 

Let's start - 

**The Original - Mary Robinette Kowal and Brandon Sanderson** (audioboook, novella) - Those are 2 of my favourite authors working together to write a thing and I enjoyed it overall. The concept was cool and the amount of world-building in a 3.5 hour long bovella is impressive. I couldnt really conect to the MC and the plot wasnt super interesting but overall a fun little novella. 3/5. 

**When the Tiger Came Down the Mountain - Nghi Vo** (ebook, novella) - I couldnt wait long after really loving the Empress of Salt and Fortune and decided to jump right to book 2. I enjoyed again the writing and the beautiful world but I think this, as a whole a little less good then the first one. The Characters (other then Chih, they're great) are less interesting overall and the mystery was less mysterious here. Still a great short read 4/5. 

**A Desollation Called Peace - Arkady Martine** (audiobook) - WOW again Martine wtore a book that made me think about it A LOT and I dont think Im done with that. Everything was even better then in the first book. My only complaint is that the plot was solved very neatly but even that is fine when you bring the overall bittersweet ending to acount. Im blown away and I really hope we'll get more stories in Teixcalaan (and if 3Seagrass and Mahit would be there that'd be cool thanks)/ 5/5.    
The narration by Amy Landon was again great IMO. 

**The Last Emperox - John Scalzi** (audiobook) - I heard before starting it that the endong was disappointing and Im here to disagree. It was probably the least good of the trilogy and it wasnt AS fun as the the first book but I still enjoyed evety minute of it. The ending was again bittersweet and I enjoyed it overall tho there are things Im not very happy with. Overall a pretty great ending to an awesome trilogy. 3.5/5.    
Should I even speak of Will Wheaton? Listen to it if you're doing audio. 

**Eric - Terry Pratchett** (audiobook) - After coming back to Rincewind and the Discworld in February and enjoying the Expirience very much I decided to keep going with the poor wizard books. Eric is very short and very funny. We're going to Troy and the Underworld of the Discworld and it's just great. How did I go half a year without advancing in the DW I don't know but Im back. 4/5.    
Nigel Planer narrated again I he was still very British in a good way :)

**Tropic of Serpents - Marie Brennan** (audiobook) - Yes, you should read The Memoirs of Lady Trent. It got dragons, lots and lots of cultural diversity in one of the usually less diverse setting of the Victorian era. It got an awesome set of characters led by Isabella that I just LOVE and the narration is done by Kate Reading which is a perfect match. [Also look at those covers](https://dyn.media.titanbooks.com/dAJ-C8VM8w8PFw9seGgGMib7gcI=/fit-in/768x0/https://media.titanbooks.com/uploads/dragon_graphic.jpg). I enjoyed this one even more then the first and if it continues to be this good I can see it being one of my favourite recommendations. 5/5. 

**Outland - Dennis E. Taylor** (audiobook) - I really enjoyed Bobiverse so when one of the audible saled included the author's debut I took it to try later. So later arrived and I have mixed feelings about the book. I usually have no problem so suspend my disbelief but here maic characters were SO competent it was a bit hard to suspend. The idea was interesting and other then the fact that the chracters were SO smart and competent well done. Also I swear that nobody in the world is thinking or talking so much about cofee lol. I did liked it after all and if the author will write a sequel I'll probably try it as well but it's not Bobiverse level. 3/5"

688,Fantasy,Does anyone else feel uncomfortable about the language in some fantasy books?,"Okay so first I know we all know that male authors are not the best at writing women. They're sexualised A LOT. Mark Lawrence's series Red Quee's War has shown so much of that in the first 20 pages.

It also used the term 'half caste'. So I'm pretty sure this isn't an okay thing to say? You shouldn't describe a poc as that, and I find it so weird it was in the book.

Is this language normal just because it's descriptive, set during times with castles and stuff? Idk I need to know someone else has noticed this lol"
689,Fantasy,Any Andre Norton Witch World officiandos who might be able to answer a question?,"As a kid in the 80s I read a book (that was probably at least 10 years old at the time based on cover style and condition of the paperback) that I think may have been one of the Witch World stories but I can't be positive based on what I could find online.


It was about a man from our earth that gets transported to a world of magic, but I can't remember much about it.  The one thing I do remember is at the end of the book he was definately forced to return to earth, leaving behind a woman who I think he loved.  It was kinda sad.


The Witch World series seems to fit the story, but I can't find anything online that mentions an ending like that - which was the one thing I really remember.  I was wondering if anyone could confirm and, if so, which exact book?  And if it doesn't fit Witch World, but strikes a bell, please let me know.  It's driven me crazy for years.  


I think the cover had a similar style to the Sorceress of Witch World (http://www.andre-norton-books.com/the-witch-world/estcarp-cycle/524-sorceress-of-the-witch-world) but was more dark greenish blue and a little creepier. That harder edge fantasy look from the 70s/80s.

694,Fantasy,is putting a prolife message in my story sexist?,"Hello I’m working on a Fanatsy story and wanted to put a pro life message in it. But when I posted it in r/fantasywinter they said I shouldn't add it because it could ruin my story and it's sexist. I’m not trying to be sexist. I want both men and women to read and enjoy my story. So do you find it sexist and do you think i should put it in my story?

The story is basically set in a fantasyland, think medieval Europe but the sex don’t really matter. men and women are considered equal. I don't want to make the world sexist or anything because i just don’t want to write that type of story.

Some of my main characters are women but I can’t make them pregnant because they’re all fighters and they can’t have a baby and fight at the same time.

There are 4 main characters in my story. 3 of them are women and 1 is a man

Each of my protagonists have powers. one has the power to control fire, one has the power to heal, one has the power to turn invisible and walk through walls and one has the ability to create earthquakes.

There are 5 parts to my story each with one of my four characters as the focus.

My first story has James who is a female and has the ability to create and control earthquakes as the main focus. they're in the main kingdom receiving orders from the king to go and stop the main villain of the overall story. But as they finish the kingdom is attacked by a monster that has the ability to create and control storms and the weathers, so they have to stay behind to defend the kingdom from the monster. This part of the story is about who becomes the leader of the team and while they all are skilled James is the one who makes the best decisions and is the most capable of leading.

The main focus of the second part of the story is Jason, who is male and has the power to control fire. This part of the story has the team come across a starving village. Jason wants to find a way to help these starving people but the rest of the team wants to go ahead with the mission because even though they want to help these people, if they don’t stop the main villain everyone in every nation could end up being killed, but Jason has a backstory of growing up extremely poor and even went days without eating so he has a very strong need to help people who are starving.

The third part of my story's main character is Jenny. She's a girl and has the ability to turn invisible and walk through walls. In this part they have to fight shadow monsters who were sent by the main villain to stop the team. The shadow monsters have the powers of darkness manipulation, invisibility, intangibility and nightmare manipulation. While the team is sleeping the shadow monsters give them nightmares and make them incapable of waking up. But Jenny is immune to their powers because she used to be a shadow beast. That's why her and the shadow beast have similar powers. She used to be evil but after realizing all the death and destruction she caused she decided to give up the evil side of her powers by asking a wizard in the kingdom to restrict them. Because those powers are evil. So it’s up to her to save her teammates by fighting off the shadow monsters while they are having nightmares

The main focus of the 4th part of the story is Emma, who is a woman and has the ability to heal. In this part of the story there on the sea and come across Ninja Knight Pirates. The story behind the ninja knight pirates is when they were six years old they started training in order to become knights. They were trained for 6 years before their village was ambushed by rogue ninjas who killed every adult there and stole their food, clothing and anything else they needed, but they took pity on the children and decided to spare them. The rogue ninjas felt bad for killing all of their parents so they decided to take them under their wing and train them in the art of Ninjutsu. But after ten years the former knights turned ninja decided to kill them because they never got over their parents murder.

But it turns out the ninjas were cursed. The ninjas were cursed with immortality and mental torment. They were cursed by a young witch whose family they killed. The witch cursed them with immortality and she also tormented them mentally to the point it feels like they are being stabbed, flayed and burnt constantly in their mind. The only way to end this is to get someone as angry as the witch was to kill the ninja. No matter how hard the ninjas tried they couldn't find someone that angry. So they had to make someone that mad. By killing the parents of the children they knew they would eventually try and kill them and so they finally have been killed. But the curse is passed on to whoever killed the ninja. So now they are cursed. But they don’t want to be like the ninjas. They don’t want to hurt innocent people and don’t even want to be tempted by the thought of it. so they went as far away from civilization as possible and became pirates wondering the sea for all eternity. But Emma can sense pain. She can tell that the Knight Ninja Pirates are in pain and heals them of their cures.

So can anyone help. Where can I fit a Pro Life message in my story without messing up the pacing or making it feel rushed."
695,Fantasy,Are dwarves stronger or tougher than humans or elves?,"I always thought there was some sort of trifecta between elves, humans, and dwarves. Something like:
Humans= standard stats. Strength through adaptation. Can acquire traits of both parties but not to the extent of either. And come in all sorts of varieties(i.e rangers,wizards,thieves,etc.).

Dwarves= shorter and slower but much stronger and heavier than a human and elf. Like if you ran into him youd just bounce off.

Elves= taller and faster than humans and dwarves but weaker and lighter than humans. Like a human can easily pick one up and throw him with one hand. 

Do I have this wrong tho? I've been writing stupid short stories in my spare time using this idea for the combat parts but I want to know if I made up some of this stuff or if its classic fantasy canon like dwarves having been made from stone.

700,Fantasy,Taarna: The Last Taarakian,"Remember Heavy Metal, the 1981 adult-themed sci-fi fantasy anthology animated film/music video? Remember the final segment, featuring Taarna, the mysterious, silent mystical warrior woman/underwear model?

Well, they're making comics about her now. There was a previous one, which was more of a sci-fi military story, where as in the movie Taarna didn't speak at all. The Last Taarakian more fits the weird mood of the film, and it honestly is the kind of weird I like. The kind where people live on innumerable worlds and can go about on starships, and yet be barbarians that fight with swords and axes, and where magic is a thing alongside weird sci-fi.

Taarna actually speaks this time around, although the narration is handled by a mysterious forces that is her ally. The original animated segment was very vague on what exactly she is, and the nature of the power her sword carries, but it all hinted at something really old and really epic. Here she is some sort of eternal, primordial warrior, locked in an endless conflict with an equally eternal force of pure chaos and destruction.

Two out of six entries are out, and I've read both on Comixology. I'm also being reminded why I normally only buy collected editions: The brevity of a normal, western comic book leaves me unfulfilled. Still, while this story hasn't truly wowed me yet, it is playing with tropes that I really like, and it does a good job of taking those vague hints from the original segment and giving more life to them, such as giving context to that ritual bath she takes before setting off to battle.

There is a sense of epicness and weirdness and ancient time, mixed with an impossibly distant future, stuffed in a blender with metal album covers. If that sounds appealing to you, maybe give this a look."

Hey guys!

To celebrate the release of the third book in my *Hollow Fate* series, I decided to make my debut novel, *A Dark Inheritance*, free until the end of Sunday (March 28th) on Amazon! (The second book, *A Darkness Beckons*, is also 99c/p in the US and UK until then.)

Here's the book one blurb:

&gt;**It’s a dark path to power.**  
&gt;  
&gt;When Ruben is bound by magic and hauled across the sea to where the God King reigns, he has only one goal: escape.  
&gt;  
&gt;As he tries to resist his master’s pull, he discovers a secret—the reason he was taken from his family—Ruben is a mage.  
&gt;  
&gt;On his journey to understand his power, his desire to become stronger takes him to dark places, driving him to do even darker things.  
&gt;  
&gt;If he can gain his freedom, will he be able to return to the life he once knew, after what he’s become?  
&gt;  
&gt;**For fans of Brandon Sanderson and Will Wight,** ***A Dark Inheritance*** **is the first book in the** ***Hollow Fate*** **series, an epic fantasy by Todd Herzman.**

Last year I entered the book into the Self-Publishing Fantasy Blog-Off (SPFBO) and was fortunate enough to get a lovely review from Adam Weller over at The Fantasy Book Critic, where he awarded it as a semi-finalist!

Hiraeth

Hiraeth – a homesickness for a place that you 
have never been, or for one that does not exist

​“Have you ever heard of Turrim?” asked the woman sitting in front of him.
​“No.” answered detective Brandoch. Brandoch leaned back into his chair watching the calm persona in front of him. “Your name is Shayleen. Now it says here that you killed twenty people. Is that true, Shayleen?”
​“I didn’t kill them. I liberated them, set them free, released their spirits to fly towards the starry sky.” Shayleen flourished and pointed at the ceiling.
​Investigator Brandoch sighed, “why should I not send you to the mental hospital?”
​“Cause I ain’t crazy. I am the only one who is sane.”
​“Alright.” And with that Brandoch left the room. Brandoch continued through the building and to his desk. After finishing his paperwork, Brandoch left for home. Once he arrived at his house, he greeted his family, as it was late, they had already eaten. Brandoch ate his dinner in silence and went to his bedroom.
​Brandoch dreamed. He dreamed of a tower, impossibly large. He entered the tower. Brandoch felt a message. He didn’t see nor hear; it was merely ingrained in his consciousness.
​“Welcome to Turrim.” It reverberated throughout his body, imposing itself on his soul. And with that Brandoch woke up. Brandoch followed a similar menial schedule. However, he decided to leave work early. He arrived at home and saw that his family was out for dinner. He took out leftovers from the night before and made his meal.
​Brandoch dreamed. He dreamed of a glade. He saw around him millions of others. Brandoch looked on his side and saw a sword. He drew the sword, it glowed faintly in the light. Brandoch spotted a town on the horizon and began making his way towards it.
​Brandoch woke up. He went through his day and fell asleep. Brandoch dreamed. He was back where he left off. He continued the exciting adventure.
​Brandoch woke up. This cycle continued for many days and nights. In the day Brandoch worked at his job. At night he went on adventures, climbing a tower. He made friends, enemies, and lovers as he went on these wonderful adventures.
​“Brandoch always used to be the most diligent worker.”
​“Yeah, now he doesn’t work very hard. I heard it was cause his marriage is struggling.”
​“Oh, I had no idea, poor thing.”
​Brandoch began to crave his nighttime adventures. He began leaving work earlier, speeding through dinner, and going to bed. In Turrim, Brandoch had no obligations, he was completely free.
​One day, Brandoch exited Turrim and found his wife and kids packed and ready to leave. His wife said “we waited so you could say goodbye”
​Kneeling down, Brandoch looked his kids in the eyes “have you ever heard of Turrim.”
​“No.” Brandoch leaned in close, “I just want to have some adventures, is that ok.”
​“Yes dad.” Brandoch stood up and waved with a smile “Goodbye, have a nice time.”
​“Bye.” Came the obligatory response. Brandoch’s wife and kids left without a backward glance. Brandoch gathered his supplies and left for work, driving through the rain. Brandoch completed his work for the day and walked out into the rain.
​Brandoch smelled the sweet petrichor and laughed. He didn’t care how others saw him, smelling the air and laughing. Brandoch got into the car and paused. He decided to get sushi from his favorite restaurant.
​Brandoch arrived home and ate his meal savoring each bite. He then removed his gun from its holster and placed it on the table. Brandoch cleaned his dishes and put them away.
​Brandoch walked to the table and placed the gun against his head. He then pulled the trigger and with a bang he died.

716,Fantasy,Review - The Bards of Bone Plain by Patricia McKilip,"This book has everything you would expect from a McKilip novel: Langorous, glinting prose; bards and magic through song; nuanced characters that resist categorisation. If not for her otherwordly style, it might almost be considered cozy. I certainly found it a warm, comforting read. 

Phelan Cle is an indifferent student at the bard school of Caerau, attendance driven by his father's frustrated ambition more than personal inclination or talent. For his graduating thesis, Phelan chooses the easiest route possible: writing about ""Nairn the Fool"", and his trials on the bone plain - a foundational myth of the kingdom. But the more he researches the topic, the more confusing its simple legend becomes. Meanwhile, ancient magics are stirring in the kingdom - could Phelan and his community be in danger?

That summary is probably more dramatic than the book itself. McKilip books are often a little slow to start, and *Bards of The Bone Plain* is no exception. That being said, her prose deserves to be savoured, and it's no trial spending time with her characters. Don't go looking for messianic stable boys, here - Phelan takes no pleasure in the bard school, his princess friend Beatrice is more interested in the local dig sites than courtly intrigue; and the kingdom, bustling with trams and cars, is tranquil. 

Drama and conflict comes from the central mystery of what happened to Nairn and its echoes through time to Phelan's present day. 

McKilip is an interesting writer. Ellipsis, mystery in an almost religious sense, is integral to her work and this book is no exception. I found the conclusion satisfying on every level, but not everything is explicated. As in real life, there are some things we know, some we suspect, and some we don't understand. I find this ambiguity refreshing, others may find it frustrating or pointless. 

I also liked the characters. Phelan's frustration with his father, Beatrice's interest in archaeology, it all felt real - which is to say not all-consuming. Lesser fantasy writers often assign characters a trait and then come back to it again and again, you end up with less a person and more an adjective personified. McKilip's characters do not always understand their own motivations; they may not active in 'logical' ways , they may surprise themselves, and the reader with what they choose. But for all that, it's believable, more believable in fact, than the too-neat choices we often see. 

I find this review is becoming a bit 'McKilipian' itself; swirling around central themes, skating over conclusions, embracing ambiguity. What can I say? She is not a writer for everyone. Lovers of hard magic, simple narratives, epic fights against ancient evils etc may be dissatisfied - even when those things are present. Her writing is more a collection of quiet moments, poignant snatches of time, snippets of dialogue or description that resonate like foundational chord. In many respects, this is a small and comforting novel; love propels nearly every character. I, in turn, loved that."

-----------------------------------------------------


*Self Published* - **No Good Dragon Goes Unpunished (Heartstrikers #3) by Rachel Aaron** 4/5 - This is the 3rd in series, so I can't say much about the plot, other than it definitely amps up the dragon and DFZ politics. There is also loads more cool dragon stuff and magic stuff. For me Aaron is pretty solid, reliable for an enjoyable read, but the quality of this series just keeps going on an upward trajectory. I also love the way Ghost's story is progressing here, there is also just a smidge of romance here that I actually appreciated given how slowly built it was.

*Chapter Epigraphs* - **A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine** 5/5 - This story follow an ambassador from a space station to kind of the big colonizing empire, after her predecessor suddenly died. It is particularly interesting because she is basically a lifelong fangirl of everything about the empire, without having actually been there, so there is a lot about her finally experiencing the things she's only read about and her misconceptions. This is very anthropological and political SF, HEAVILY focused on culture, I put it pretty akin ot the Hainish Novels. Loved pretty much everything about it and am loving the sequel now.

*Published 2020* - **Catherine House by Elisabeth Thomas** 4/5 - So, this is kind of like if we took all the students from Brakebills who are all a bit broken, miserable, and yet at least slightly narcissistic... then put them at a totally isolated intensive academic university that's only slightly off and they have no adventures. The protagonist is bi or pan, there is lots of partying, hooking up, and hangovers. This is full of mundanity of college studenthood (sneaking cookies from the cafeteria at all hours, skipping classes, shenanigans) and feeling like your particular group is all that exists. But then there is also this foundational weird speculative element at the fringes of the story, just barely there, but ominous all the same. I really enjoyed the writing and story, it is a very strong debut, though I would have liked a more clean conclusion and more of the speculative element, I was disappointed more overt weirdness wasn't present.

*Set in a School* - **Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo** 4/5 - Alex has had a much less than charmed upbringing, and is abundantly aware of it as she enters Yale's freshman class. However, she is uniquely appealing to the campus secret societies that are obsessed with touching the paranormal at any cost, as a past trauma left her changed. Drugs, violence, and missing persons are rampant; the rich/powerful misbehaving (getting away with murder if you will...) a major theme. Oddly enough, this is a real setting, but I think the worldbuilding is by far the strong suit, I could wholeheartedly buy that this is actually going on at Yale today, and is FASCINATING. There is a lot of symbolism and ancient history to uncover here as well. The things that fell flat for me were mainly to do with the downtrodden special girl setup.

*Book About Books* - **The Archive of the Forgotten (Hell's Library #2) by A.J. Hackwith** 4/5 - Things are getting back to normal after the tumult of the last adventure, when a pool of ink mysteriously appears in the library. The librarian and the arcanist butt heads about what to do with it, putting them as opponents rather than allies for the first time. Each is so convicted in her approach, they begin secretly taking riskier and riskier experiments to prove their theories. At the very same time, a different duo are off on a mission traversing realms and libraries in search of any information on their strange ink problem. I once again really enjoyed this entry in the series, I found the settings inventive while also incorporating new spins on mythic elements. The actual plot felt like it hit a lot of the same beats as the first book, and the minor romance subplot was quite predictable, yet a delight anyway when it played out. This is just my kind of story and I look forward to more."
723,Fantasy,Recommendations for Fantasy with Romance??,"Hi y’all, 

I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations of fantasy books that have well developed romances. I’ll list some things I enjoy below, but your book doesn’t have to fit any of them! 

things i like in books:

- enemies to lovers
- forbidden romance
- person A pretends they don’t like person B but they do
- accidentally hurting each other without realizing it because of a secret that will get revealed
- bad person A turns good after realizing they can’t hurt person B

some books i’ve read and enjoyed:

- everything by Renee Andieh
- Serpent and Dove
- Girls of Paper and Fire
- From Blood and Ash
- i honestly can’t remember more than that lol

Thanks y’all :)"
724,Fantasy,Advice?,"Since I was really little I would always fantasise about fictional worlds. From 2018, I had made up a world of my own that helped me cope with my tough reality.

On top of that, it helped me happily cope with my self image which was very low at the time. I soon realised that if it helped me, it should be able to help other girls like me.

After some time, I decided to write my fantasises down. At first, like some other writers, I hated writing. It took me well over a year for it to become tolerable. I kept going because I really wanted my story to be famous. 

Three years have passed and I’m a whole lot mature. I have found another passion besides wanting to become an author. I want to become a well known beautician. 

Growing up has also made me question if other people also have fantasises as a kid, and it’s natural for them to let it go as they mature. Hence, I fear my fantasies will shortly start to die down and I need to focus on the other career I want.

However, that honestly may not be the case for me. Since I constantly fantasise, I may have a fantasising disorder, namely Fantasy Prone Disorder. 

Words cannot describe how much I love my world. And it hurts that years of writing, editing, writing and editing may go to waste. Not to mention I’m worried that if I shun out my fantasies, I would be shunning out what I have loved doing the most for the rest of my life.

And who knows, maybe it’s a gift I need to put out there for others to enjoy? 

My question is if I should continue writing after successfully becoming a well known beautician, or if I should let my novel go?"
725,Fantasy,Bingo - First Row Review,"This is my first time attempting the bingo and since I, unfortunately, started late, I will not be able to finish up a full card. I retro-actively attempted to file-in my 2020 reads, but not all books ended up qualifying. No bugger: I managed to complete one row, one column, and one diagonal.

This is my first-row review. Have fun! I'll be putting no ratings since I enjoyed all books.

 **Novel Translated from its Original Language**: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoi, written in Russian, read in French

Yes. The beast. While not technically fantasy per se, it is historical fiction which is a sub-category usually filled in under fantasy and it is massive, it has to count.

What is it about? It is the tale of Russian families striving through the Napoleonic Wars: the battles are real, the historical figures are very real, the depiction of the battlefields felt more real than most modern fantasy, but the characters are fictional. It has politics, battle, romance. It tackles depression, suicide, death, motherhood in a time prior to modern medicine, rich to pauper, pauper to rich, and it was written in the mid-19th century. The whole tale simply feels so... authentic and much easier to read than I anticipated. I was surprised by some modern thematic being pushed into the story. Andrei is most definitely depressive, Natasha contemplates suicide, some parts are rather grim... 

What did I like about it? The sheer ambition of it, War and Peace is a saga, an epic before epic even existed. I also enjoyed the realism, the details, and the historical content.

Why does it fit? Well... It was written in Russian, it is fiction, it has no magic, but it reconnects with fantasy's main thematics. It has growing-up, coming of age, and battles, oh, grim battles. 

Who is it for? Fans of classical literature, readers interested in 19th-century literature, fans of historical fiction with a taste for literature

 **Setting Featuring Snow, Ice, or Cold**: The Terror by Dan Simmons

I have been wanting to read this book ever since it was released. I have always been fascinated with the Franklin expedition and its grim disappearance: a century-old mystery. It was perfect for this square.

What is it about? It is a fictionalization of the doomed Franklin expedition. It follows some of its members, both real and fictional, as the boats get locked into ice, as food gets scarce, the cold, and a strange creature hunting the crew. The monster on the ice, here inspired by Inuk mythology, adds an element of horror to an already grim tale as anyone familiar with the Franklin knows how the story ends.

What did I like about it? It's a tragedy! This isn't unlike watching the Titanic: we all know the boat sinks, what matters is the story unfolding as it happens. The Terror is about the same. All characters are doomed to die and yet, I so wanted most of them to survive!

Why does it fit? Duh. 700 pages of stranded men trying to survive in an arctic ice death field. The ice and the cold basically are the main protagonists.

Who is it for? Fans of the Franklin expedition, fans of mild horror and claustrophobic tales, fans of slow-paced ambiance-filled stories.

Other Squares: Exploration

 **Optimistic SFF**: The Trials of Apollo

After reading Madeline Miller's fantastic Circe, last winter, I have been craving Greek mythology-themed books. Hence I have read Percy Jackson and the Heroes of Olympus despite those being targeted at a young audience. The Trials of Apollo is the third series set in this world, it is comprised of five books, and I put them all up for this square as no character is as refreshing, funny, and yet touching as Apollo.

What is it about? Following the events in the Heroes of Olympus, Olympus's residing jerk, Zeus, seeks a culprit and narrows down on his teenage-like-son Apollo. He casts him off Olympus, locks him into the powerless mortal body of an unathletic acne-prone teenager. The horror! Then proceeds Apollo's quest towards regaining his power and his place on the Olympus while pondering if he actually wants it back. It is a tale of self-discovery, adventure, and growth. While not technically a teenager (he is 4100 years old, give or take a few years), Apollo seems forever to be... 16. 

What did I like about it? The main protagonist! Seriously. It may be a kids' book, but dawn it does have great character building. Apollo is just fantastic to read about.

Why does it fit? It is funny and as with other books in the series, it is filled with its author's insane imagination. It is cheerful and has you rooting for its main protagonist. Apollo is selfish, arrogant, superficial and half a coward, but he's also very sympathetic, touching, a victim of house-hold abuse, and watching him finally grow puts a smile on your face.

Who is it for? Fans of Riordan's other series, fans of greek mythology who don't mind reading books meant for a younger audience.

Other squares: Books that made me Laugh.

 **Novel Featuring Necromancy**: The Crooked Kingdom by Leigh Bargudo

This is the Six of Crows sequel and it follows the gang makes it back to Ketterdam and tries to outwit evil Van Eck.

What is it about? Revenge, mostly. All interested parties want to be able to create Jurda Parem, the addictive drugs used on Grisha. Kuwei, the son of its inventor, protected by Kaz and the gang, is sought after. Follows heist, infiltration, kidnapping, powers rediscovered, and yes, sadly, death.

What did I like about it? Heist, gangs, smart kids, action: this book never rests. It also features some of the characters from the Shadow and Bones as both series overlap. Give me more Nikolai anyday.

Why does it fit? Because after having taken Jurda Parem to save her crew, back in Six of Crows, Nina recovers and realizes his Grisha powers have... changed. She can now control bones and, well, raise the dead, which she does, of course.

Who is it for? Fans of the Grishaverse, fans of Six of Crows.

 **Ace / Aro Spec Fic**: The Thessaly Trilogy by Joe Walton

Bored Athena seeks to fill in a few centuries of her eternity on her new pet project: re-creating Plato's Republic. She enrolls her brother Apollo, seeking to understand the nature of consent. Masters are picked all across the ages, an island scheduled to be destroyed within a few centuries, long lost in Antiquity is found and, with the help from futuristic technology, the experiment begins as a thousand former kids slaves are brought in.

What is it about? It is about Plato's Republic coming to life following the rules Plato himself wrote sometimes during Antiquity. The kids are sorted into groups, they live in dorms, they are taught philosophy among other things, all according to Plato, and they strive to be their better selves. Once old enough, they are given their ranking within their society: gold, silver, and bronze (except there is a catch, the master limits the number of kids who can get gold...). The masters genuinely believe the life they offer to the kids is the best possible life: a life spent studying philosophy, Plato's republic, what could be missing? Freedom. Then ensue a long trek towards the main characters realizing the nature of consent (yes, Apollo, hiding as one of the kids does learn what it means) while some of the masters come to realize in wanting to free the kids from slavery, they have enslave them within another form of slavery as there can never be true enlightement without freedom of choice. Socrate makes a very notable appearance in this series and it is all around fantastic. The sequels follow the next generations and how the ""project evolves"".

What did I like about it? The philosophy! The book is rich in discussing Plato's work, philosophy, freedom and consent. As I read the first book, I thought all philosophy teachers should make their students read this book because it is so well explained, interesting, and it opens up for interesting debates.

Why does it fit? Because, according to Plato, the ideal relationship is one of closeness of the soul, not the bodies. He essentially promote what would be described, in our days, as an ace relationship. The two main characters end up having one of those relationship: they have sex only once throughout their life together. The series also gives focus to Crokus, a worker robot, who come to awareness and, off course, does not care for romantic relationships thought he forms many relationship with others. The last book of the series, Necessity, all has pod relationship implying five consentent adults all engaged in relationships I would consider mostly ace.

Who is it for? Fans of philosophy, fans of Antiquity, fans of books that makes you think.

726,Fantasy,WARNING : Book Bingo-virus highly contagious ! (possible side effects: full bingo card and some reviews),"&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nothing is impossible.  
The word itself says: ""I'm possible""!  
*Audrey Hepburn*

&amp;#x200B;

**Before unveiling the books on my bingo card, I'd first like to thank:**

u/Miguelular ... for introducing me to this book bingo a few weeks ago. If it weren't for him, I'd probably never have discovered ...

u/Fantasy ... where my love for SFF-books does only continue to grow out of proportion. Thanks to book bingo I was finally motivated to catch up on my backlog for my reading challenge of 100 books a year on ...

***Goodreads*** ... where my friends help me to discover both popular and - above all - less known books. Some of them are also active here on Reddit. Waving to u/Miguelular, u/barb4ry1 and u/RAYMONDSTELMO 😉

Thank you all for encouraging and inspiring me!

&amp;#x200B;

**Book Bingo-virus appears to be highly contagious.**

Even though I discovered this book bingo just recently, I made a big effort past month to read 13 books in order to complete my bingo card. Because I'd really like to have that bingo-flair 😄

And yes, I admit that I'm totally bitten now! For next year's bingo there are already lots of titles waiting on my shelves. I even set an extra goal to myself: only reading books with less than 100 reviews on Goodreads. Because there exist so many unknown and underrated gems out there and I'm totally ready to discover them!

Or as Ralph Waldo Emerson said:

&gt;""Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.""

&amp;#x200B;

**But first things first.**

During this bingo year I discovered 38 new SFF-authors. Actually Martha Wells was the only one from whom I already read a book. This high amount is also due to the fact that for the 'short stories'-square I read an anthology with 15 different writers who don't occur in the other squares.

Despite a few letdowns, I gave a lot of 4 and 5\* which isn't that common for me. Just take a look at my average rating on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102008338-tau) and you'll see what I mean.

The things that appeal most to me in books are originality and humour.

I could say much more, but my list is already long enough to fill up my first post here. So without further ado I present to you my Book Bingo-books of 2020:

&amp;#x200B;

**FIRST ROW ACROSS**

[**De cirkel**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18749571-de-cirkel) **by** ***Dave Eggers*** **⭐⭐**

**Novel translated from its original language**

A dystopic SF-thriller about a powerful internet company that gains more and more influence.

It was originally published in English as 'The Circle', but I read the Dutch translation. As a Belgian my native languages are Dutch and French, so sometimes I read books in these languages. Although English is definitely my favourite and thus my main reading language. The fact that lots of interesting SFF-books aren't translated also contributes to this habit.

Probably my expectations of this book were too high. Read it in May 2020 and as I don't have a lot of memories of it, the least I can say is that it didn't make a lasting impression. For as far as I can remember, the story was quite boring and there were some plotholes.

[**The Wound of Words**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53304481-the-wound-of-words) **by** ***Deborah Makarios*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Setting featuring snow, ice or cold / HARD MODE: the entire book takes place in this setting**

An original humorous fantasy novel by a female author from New-Zealand.

Despite being nominated in the SPFBO 6 (the sixth edition of the Self-Publishing Fantasy Blog-Off organized by author Mark Lawrence), this book only had two reviews and ratings on Goodreads. But those were enough to spark my curiosity.

The first 20% forms a rather slow beginning. But once the journey starts, it's full ahead.  
Never thought I would ever say this, but : ""I was totally in love with the fountain!""  
Curious what got into me? Just read this book and find out for yourself 😋

[**The Humans**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130537-the-humans) **by** ***Matt Haig*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Optimistic SFF / HARD MODE: not Becky Chambers**

A humorous SF-novel about Professor Andrew Martin, whose body is invaded by an alien.

Read the Dutch version ('De wezens') of this book which I won in a contest a few years ago. As I've got literally hundreds of unread books on my shelves, I seldom read books immediately after I buy or win them (and yes, I'm very lucky in game, not so much in love though). But I'm glad I finally got around to this one, because it was my introduction to Matt Haig from whom there are some other books waiting on my shelves.

Lots of accurate human observations and interesting thoughts are wrapped in this entertaining story.

[**Prince of Fools**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25262299-prince-of-fools) **by** ***Mark Lawrence*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel featuring necromancy**

First book in the fantasy-installment of The Red Queen's War.

Like most of the books I've read during the past few months, this one was also an introduction to an author from whom I never read something before.

The humour and banter were quite good, but the worldbuilding fell a bit flat for me as it was clearly based on Europe. Talking to Americans, I now understand better where the fascination for Europe may come from. Nevertheless it was not very original in my eyes.

[**Artificial Condition**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36223860-artificial-condition) **by** ***Martha Wells*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Ace-Aro Spec Fic / HARD MODE: Ace-Aro protagonist**

The second book in the Murderbot-series.

During this book bingo period I've read three Murderbot-novellas: Artificial Condition, Rogue Protocol &amp; Exit Strategy.

Artificial Condition definitely is my favourite in this installment because of the humour which is more pronounced. Totally loved ART!

&amp;#x200B;

**SECOND ROW ACROSS**

[**The Silent Companions**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36434359-the-silent-companions) **by** ***Laura Purcell*** **⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel featuring a ghost**

This debut novel is inspired by the work of Shirley Jackson and Susan Hill and set in a crumbling country mansion.

Although I seldom read ghost stories, this one caught my attention by its beautiful cover. The book already stood on my shelf since a few years and thanks to book bingo it finally ended up on top of my reading-stack.

Slow but atmospheric read. Even though the setting is in the UK instead of the USA, it really has some vibes of the movie 'The Skeleton Key'. But the story would've been even better if it were a bit shorter (sometimes too much repetition now) and if some plotholes were better elaborated.

[**One Day All This Will Be Yours**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54303485-one-day-all-this-will-be-yours) **by** ***Adrian Tchaikovsky*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel featuring exploration**

A humorous read about time traveling.

Although it sounds unbelievable, this was the first book I read by this reknown author who already has many works to his credit. So I went in without prior knowledge or expectations.

Totally loved the humour and the characters of Miffly and Zoe! Those definitely merit 5\*. There were also very interesting thoughts discussed. But some of the interludes felt a bit like page-filling with a lot of repetition of the same ideas over and over again. That's why the overall impression of this book gets 4\*.

[**Ice**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34776861-ice) **by** ***Anna Kavan*** **⭐⭐**

**Climate should play a significant role in the story / HARD MODE: not post-apocalyptic**

Psychedelic 'best SF-novel of the year 1967'.

Bought this book a few years ago. But - while it appealed to me - I was also a bit scared to begin in this 'classic' because I expected it to be very experimental. Which it turned out to be. But thanks to book bingo I now finally read it and I'm very glad for that!

The world as we know it is getting covered with ice. If  there's one thing that can be said about this book, it's that it procures a very estranging reading sensation. You get the feeling to be trapped  in an ice labyrinth of thoughts and impressions with no way out. There  is so much symbolism woven through, both on a smaller  (autobiographical?) level as on the much larger scale of society. On both levels human nature is stripped to it's core. And that leaves a  rather cold, cruel and depressing taste. Many are the readers who have tried to explain this book. Some saw an allegory in it for the Cold War. Others believed it referred to the author's addiction to heroin (also called 'snow'). Gave it 2,5\* and rounded it down because the messages would resonate even more if the story  were a bit shorter. Now it loses some of its power by repeating some parts just too many times.

[**The Brass Queen**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48759186-the-brass-queen) **by** ***Elizabeth Chatsworth*** **⭐**

**Novel with a colour in the title / HARD MODE: not black, red, grey, white**

A steampunk historical romance.

Was able to read this one because my 'wish was granted' on NetGalley. You know how they always say: ""Be careful what you wish for""? Sadly enough, that totally applies to this book.

And yes, 'brass' is considered a colour (look [here](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/brass)) 😉

Already put too much time and effort in reading this one. If you want to get an idea of my overall thoughts, you can read my full review [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3542752231).

[**What Was Your Name Downriver?**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55076285-what-was-your-name-downriver) **by** ***Anthony Lowe*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Any** u/Fantasy **book club book off the month or** u/Fantasy **read-along book / HARD MODE: participate in the discussion**

Atmospheric, entertaining and humorous western fantasy.

Apart from the comic book [The Transporter](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3492839703) I'd never read a western fantasy before. So when Anthony Lowe offered his book for free (and was so kind to provide me an epub), I didn't hesitate to immerse myself in this subgenre. And it was totally worth it!

The mid-month spoiler-free discussion can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/m49cni/bookclub_what_was_your_name_downriver_by_anthony/). My review will follow soon. But I can already reveal that although the first pages were a bit more difficult to get fully into the  story (probably because there wasn't much action yet), I immediately liked the atmosphere that was depicted. Most of the other readers describe it as 'darker than expected'. Although some events may come across as quite dark, I didn't really feel it that way.  Because of the humor and banter between the two female protagonists, Evaline and Trivan, it felt rather light hearted to me. And I liked it!

&amp;#x200B;

**THIRD ROW ACROSS**

[**The Reincarnation of Tom**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52794132-the-reincarnation-of-tom) **by** ***Aden Simpson*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Self-published SFF-novel (HARD MODE: at the time it had fewer than 50 ratings on Goodreads, but now it has more)**

Original, intelligent, funny. This is how the book could be described in 3 words. It certainly is like nothing you've ever read before.

Discovering less known books (often self-published) is one of the things I like most about reading. Of course, sometimes you'll be disappointed (look at my review of 'The brass queen'). But when you find true gems like this book (or 'What was your name downriver' or one of the many others I discovered, both in SFF as in other genres), it gives you such a satisfying feeling!

As the title already indicates, this book is about the reincarnation of Tom. Over and over and over again. Despite  the innumerable amount of characters (animals, people, …) in which Tom reincarnates and thus the many different chapters, a beautiful whole is formed by the clever links that are made between all these lives. Masterfully done. My full review can be read [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3468381733).

[**A Most Magical Girl**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30898992-a-most-magical-girl) **by** ***Karen Foxlee*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel with chapter epigraphs / HARD MODE: original to the novel**

A children's fantasybook that is way darker than you would expect.

Before COVID-19 book markets were a favourite place to go for me. It happened more than once to come home with 15 or 20 books. This book is from one of those book hauls.

Sometimes you can predict everything what's going to happen in children's books, but not with this one. Well, for some parts you can, but for others not. And that's refreshing.  Every chapter begins with a quote from the fictional ""Miss Finch's Little Blue Book (1855)"". This ads a nice touch to the whole. If you want to know more about my reading experience, head over to my [review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3289967660).

[**Sweet Harmony**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54359267-sweet-harmony) **by** ***Claire North*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel published in 2020**

Dark story that could become reality one day. Who knows?

Despite having all the books of Claire North figuring on my 'to be read'-list, I never came around to read one of them. Till now.

This story is all about the dangers of pursuing perfection. Harmony wants to be perfect and doesn't hesitate to pay a high price for it. The present storyline alternates with flashbacks to show us how Harmony became the woman she is today. The only thing that bothered me a bit was the overuse of the ellipsis (...) to emphasize unspoken thoughts. Although I don't care much for appearance (which forms the main theme of the book), the story was able to hold my attention thanks to the intriguing ideas and the dark tone.

[**Every Heart a Doorway**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25526296-every-heart-a-doorway) **by** ***Seanan McGuire*** **⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel set in a school or university - HARD MODE: not Harry Potter or The Magicians**

The first book in the Wayward Children-series about children who went to different worlds through magical portals and then came back.

Even though I never read something from Seanan McGuire before, her books appealed to me and I decided that this one would be a good starter.

Maybe my expectations were too high. Or maybe her books aren't entirely my cup of tea after all. Probably it's a bit of both. Fact is that I didn't really feel a connection with this book and gave it 2,5\*. Rounded it up because some ideas (other worlds) and references were nice and/or original. But overall it felt too YA to me, both in reactions of the characters as in the predictability of some plot points. Furthermore some things felt too forced, especially the gender diversity. Just to be clear: I absolutely don't mind if people are different (in whatever way), but in this book there was so much emphasis on that theme, that it became a bit annoying. I much prefer if those things are just described naturally.

[**Het levende boek**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7343231-het-levende-boek) **by** ***Peter Van Olmen*** **⭐⭐⭐**

**Book about books**

A Belgian children's book (in Dutch) about the quest of a little girl looking for her father in Scribopolis, a magical town where famous writers live and book characters come to life.

As I accidentally bought the second book in this series (not knowing it was a sequel), I didn't hesitate to take the first book with me when I saw it in a free library. Being rather thick books of around 500 pages each and wanting to create some space on my bookshelves again, I decided it was finally time to read the first part. Lots of thanks to book bingo for the push in the right direction.

For the original ideas alone this book deserves 4\*. The writing style was very smooth and thus reading this doorstopper didn't take too much time. But there was something odd about the level. Sometimes there were quite a lot of rather adult references (which children probably won't even pick up). While other times it seemed like a typical children's book because of the predictability and the childwise way of reasoning. It seemed to me as if the author wasn't able to choose for which audience to write. Which makes the book sometimes too childish for adults and too grown-up for some children.

&amp;#x200B;

**FOURTH ROW ACROSS**

[**Zeus Grants Stupid Wishes**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15808302-zeus-grants-stupid-wishes) **by** ***Cory O'Brien*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**A book that made you laugh / HARD MODE: not Terry Pratchett**

Discover world mythology stories told in a stand-up comedian kind of way.

As I said earlier, humour is something I consciously look for in books (and elsewhere too for that matter). So actually there are several books from this book bingo that would fit in this square (all hard mode). I shuffled and reshuffled my squares quite a lot to be able to make a full bingo and this book was the one that finally stayed in this square.

It really is as if you're reading stand-up comedy. And what's best: if you look up the original stories, you see that Cory O'Brien is so right about all of it. Hilarious. Little warning: it's best to read this book in bits and pieces, because otherwise it can get 'too much'. If you want to have an idea of the writing style, you can check out myths from all around the world on the former website of Cory O'Brien: [Better Myths](https://bettermyths.com/387-2/). Some of the myths he discusses in the book are also there, but not all of  them and not entirely in the same form. And if you're in the mood for some music, make sure to listen to his [rap song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogOTuT-AqLw). If they would present it that way at school, even more students would like mythology.

[**Escape POD**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52026057-escape-pod) **by** ***several authors*** **⭐⭐⭐**

**Five SFF short stories / HARD MODE: entire SFF anthology**

Anthology of 15 SF-stories to celebrate the 15th year anniversary of the science-fiction podcast Escape Pod (one for each candle apparently) and written by authors whose works were covered in the podcast  previously.

Short stories are a fun way to get to know new authors. You immediately get a good idea of their writing style, plot building, humour, ... without having to read an entire book. If the story isn't to your liking, it's too bad but at least you didn't lose too much time. If the story is good, you can often add a lot of books to your TBR-list.

The authors who surprised me most were T. Kingfisher, Ken Liu and Cory Doctorow. Discussing all the stories of this anthology in this post would lead us too far, but if you want to know which ones are included and why I (dis)liked them, you're very welcome to check out my [review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3602918158).

[**Silver in the Wood**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43459657-silver-in-the-wood) **by** ***Emily Tesh*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Big dumb object**

A mythical forest forms the background of this enchanting read.

When I learned about book bingo at the end of February, this square seemed one of the hardest to fill. And then, all of sudden I thought: ""Wouldn't Mostly Harmless by Douglas Adams count for this one?"" When I googled, one of the search results showed me a very interesting [thesis about The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/bitstream/handle/1956/22553/Prestegard_Master-s-Thesis.pdf). If you take a look at it, you'll find more info about the BDO-aspect of this trilogy in five parts, starting at page 25. ""It's in the pocket,"" I thought. Wrong! One week before book bingo ended, I realized that I didn't read this book at the beginning of April 2020 (like I assumed), but at the end of March. So my intention was to reread it now, exactly one year after I read it for the first time. A bit symbolic, you know, for the first year that passed since the first Covid-lockdown here in Belgium (which makes us turn in circles too). Until I found the recommendation of 'Silver in the Wood' in the [BDO-thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/hzf5ay/bingo_focus_thread_bdo_big_dumb_object/) of u/Dianthaa. As I seldom reread books and this one was still unread on my shelf, I decided that it would fit my BDO-square very well.

Even though I'm not such a fan of woods (I absolutely prefer open plains as far as the eye can see, like in Iceland) and despite the rather slow pace of the story, I ended up enjoying this book way more than expected. The tone, which was dark and light at the same time, totally immersed me into the world of Tobias and Henry Silver.

[**The Call**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30292416-the-call) **by** ***Peadar Ó Guilin*** **⭐⭐⭐**

**Feminist novel &gt; replaced by a square from previous bingo: a SFF novel featuring a character with a disability**

A rather dark YA (some call it horror) in an Irish setting.

Being a feminist myself, it should've been easy to read a feminist novel. And the truth is that I have some of the titles, which were recommended in different threads here, on my shelf. But they all were quite thick and bearing in mind that I already planned several other thick books past month it just wasn't doable. So I decided to use my right to subsitute one square by a category from the previous bingo. My choice fell on 'novel featuring a character with a disability' as the protagonist of The Call fits perfectly in this requirement.

A high paced - and thus quickly read - story. Although I enjoyed the dark setting with references to ancient Irish folklore and Sídhes, the story felt very YA-like and too predictable by times. The characters were flat and the emphasis was totally on the action. Not bad, but not exceptional either. Nice book for in between more heavy ones.

[**Pundragon**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54337338-pundragon) **by** ***Chandra K. Clarke*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel by a Canadian author / HARD MODE: book from a Canadian small press or self-published Canadian author**

As another reviewer described it: ""Let’s imagine that Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams and the Monty Python guys would have met in a pub, and after a considerable amount of beers, decided to write a modern version of ‘Alice in Wonderland’. The result could have been ‘Pundragon’.""

Even though the cover didn't appeal to me at first sight, the few reviews that appeared on Goodreads were enough for me to give this book a try. No regrets at all!

I could tell you all about the different sorts of humour in this book (sarcasm, lots of puns, ...). Or about the original quest of 30-year-old Ian Laughlin MacDonald and hot pink dragon Ether. But instead I invite you to read my [review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3468355500) and/or my [interview with the author](https://world-of-tau.blogspot.com/2020/09/pundragon.html).

**FIFTH ROW ACROSS**

[**Last One at the Party**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55478680-last-one-at-the-party) **by** ***Bethany Clift*** **⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel with a number in the title**

What if you were the sole survivor of a very contagious virus?

As I like to discover less know books and authors, I also regularly read debuts. Just like this one.

It's November 2023. The  human race has been wiped out by the 6DM virus (Six Days Maximum - the  longest you've got before your body destroys itself). There's only one survivor, a woman, who tells about how she tries to survive in a world without other people, internet, fresh food in shops, ... Being in the middle of the corona crisis, this book may not be for everyone. But if you're up to it, you can read my [review](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55478680-last-one-at-the-party).

[**To Dream in Daylight**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54421974-to-dream-in-daylight) **by** ***Candace J. Thomas*** **⭐**

**Romantic fantasy / paranormal romance**

Love story about a boy and a girl who met each other in their dreams. Until they find out that the other one really exists. Will they finally meet in real?

Characters meeting each other in their dreams ... apparently this is a recurrent theme. Because in just a few weeks time I read two of them. The other one was the graphic novel [Dreamless](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9330885-dreamless), a World War II romance about an American girl and a Japanese boy who have seen each other's lives in their sleep since birth. It can also be read online as a webcomic. You can find the link in my short [review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3473354774).

Although I've got a very broad reading taste (SFF forms only a part of my reading), somehow I seldom seem to appreciate romances. Most of the times they're not credible and/or I don't feel the chemistry between the characters. That this was also the case with this book is clear from my rating. If you want to know why this book was an absolute disappointment, you can read my [review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3487049802).

[**The Girl Who Drank the Moon**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35666866-the-girl-who-drank-the-moon) **by** ***Kelly Barnhill*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel with a magical pet / HARD MODE: magical pet can also speak**

Beautifully written fairytale with a dark touch that will also (or mostly?) appeal to an older public.

As I was immediately in love with the cover and the title, and the story seemed interesting, I was very curious to discover this book that won lots of awards.

This magical children's book tells us the story of a sacrificed baby, a good witch and their 'pets' (a wise Swamp Monster and a Perfectly Tiny Dragon). If you want to know more about my reading experience, you can read my small [review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3287372662).

[**On a Sunbeam**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36952615-on-a-sunbeam) **by** ***Tillie Walden*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Graphic novel / HARD MODE: stand alone graphic novel**

Inspiring story of growing up, friendship, love, adventure, … supported by beautiful drawings.

I've always loved graphic novels and paper comics. But it's only since corona that I also discovered webcomics. This one was a bull's eye.

This graphic novel - featuring only female characters - was originally published as webcomic (and can still be read online). You'll find the link and more information about the book and the author in my [review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3269682440).

[**Qualityland**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48717763-qualityland) **by** ***Marc Uwe-Kling*** **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**

**Novel featuring politics / HARD MODE: not featuring royalty**

Brilliant SF-satire of a nearby future! Or is it of today's world? A mix of both, I guess.

Never thought I would find a book for this square, as I really hate politics. If you wonder why: just google 'government Belgium' and discover that we've got over 70 (!) ministers in our small country. During corona Belgians even found out (yes, you heard it well, most of us didn't even know it) that apparently we've got 9 ministers of health. No wonder that politicians are a real laughing stock in our country. Anyway, I suddenly thought of this book and I totally enjoy it! To be totally honest, I'm still reading it at the moment (well over halfway now). As soon as I've finished it, I'll send in my book bingo form. Although I normally don't rate a book before I've read it entirely, this one is so original and humorous that it already deserves 5\*.

There are two main storylines: one about Peter Jobless and his job, relationships, ... and one about politics as two candidates (one of them an AI) are running for president. There are lots of side characters and everything is told in short chapters, switching from one situation/character to another. The whole is interspersed with news articles and the reactions on them. There are so many interesting ideas, the form in which it's presented is very attractive and the humour is absolutely hilarious! Totally recommended!"

728,Fantasy,Has anyone seen research related to why certain brains prefer the fantasy genre?,"There seems to be a lot of research about what reading DOES to people, but I don't care about benefits of reading or how fiction readers are more empathetic or whatever. I want to know if there is a certain personality type/brain type, etc that is drawn to fantasy stories.

I ask because I come from a family of readers, and I grabbed on to fantasy at a super young age and never let go. While the rest of my family members read just as much, their genres are much different. So, I know it wasn't learned; it was a preference. No matter how much I google I can't seem to find any info on this. Anyone seen anything?"
729,Fantasy,"Authors with a terse, minimalistic writing style?","I love a bit of fantasy (sci-fi) and I'm a fan of Hemingway's writing style. I also think McCarthy is great. 

I am easily put off by melodramatic and purple writing and will only slog through long convoluted sentences and paragraphs (which I need to read three to four times to comprehend) if I'm really into the story. 

I don't want or need paragraphs explaining clothing, the sky, the sea or the simple act of walking up stairs. 

I tried getting through *Memory, Sorrow and Thorn* but couldn't carry on after about 3/4 of the way through the first book because it was too wordy. Although it was one time I could appreciate it because he creates a great atmosphere. 

I had to stop *Empire of Silence* even though I want to know what happens, because the prose was so purple I wanted to vomit multiple times a page. 

To out it bluntly, I don't like pretentious writing. Are there any terse/minimalistic/blunt fantasy authors out there? 

I know I'm picky but I read for the fun of the story. Not for  ""beautiful"" and complex prose which requires brain power   to decipher. 

Thanks!"

733,Fantasy,"I somehow managed to fill TWO bingo cards this year, so here they are","It's been a year, huh? I think I actually managed to read more books this year than ever before, through a combination of sheer boredom/house arrest and the fact that my local library finally embraced e-lending in a big way.  I got full use out of the Libby and Hoopla apps on my phone, and I might actually have to look at getting a dedicated e-reader.  Putting a couple hundred books through my phone screen didn't do my eyes any favor.

That being said, with my booklog clocking in at a ridiculous 200+ titles, I probably shouldn't be surprised that I filled more than one card.  Here's what I read this year:

**Row 1 - Card 1**

* **Translated**  *The Dwarves* by Markus Heitz.  I didn't actually find out this was translated til well after I'd read it and the sequel.  My initial reaction was that the worldbuilding didn't have a whole lot of exposition and there were bits that seemed to be missing, but that might've just been lost in the translation.  Fairly classic fantasy tropes about the outsider going on the hero's journey to retrieve the MacGuffin to save the world.
* **Snow, Ice, or Cold**  *The Crystal Shard* by R.A. Salvatore (hard).  I finally got around to reading a Drizzt Do'Urden book, and I can see why the kids like them so much.  This is some straight up wish-fulfillment D&amp;D prose, laying out the good guys and the bad guys and then saying ""Let them FIGHT!""  And it's no surprise that all the good guys are badasses, and all the bad guys get what they deserve.  Took me back to my Dragonlance days, for sure.
* **Optimistic**  *Akata Witch* by Nnedi Okorafor (hard).  When this turned up available in the library, I jumped on it.  It gets called ""African Harry Potter"" sometimes, but it's not, really.  It's about finding a place in the world where you fit, and finding people who fit with you, and how even when trouble comes your way, you can meet it head on with the support of your family - whether it's blood family or not.  Great, great book, one of my favorites this year.
* **Necromancy**  *Harrow the Ninth* by Tamsyn Muir (hard).  I started reading this the day it arrived, got confused as hell about 30 pages in, and powered through anyway.  Got to the end, grabbed *Gideon* back off the shelf and read that to make sure I wasn't crazy, spotted like six things that were retro-foreshadowed (Is that a word? Aftershadowed?) and then immediately re-read Harrow again.  The story is fine, for what it is - Harrow's derangement and anguish is punctured regularly by bits that literally made me snort, aghast, at the *audacity*, but I love this...whatever that Muir is doing for the sheer *levels* of complexity.  Like, it's obviously heavily religious, what with the nuns and the bible verses and the prayers, but there's also Edgar Allan Poe, and Homestuck, and Llamas with Hats, and about sixteen other levels to this mess that I've barely scratched the surface. But still, that *fucking* dad joke almost made me throw it across the room.
* **Ace/Aro**  *Every Heart a Doorway* by Seanan McGuire (hard).  This had been sitting on my TBR for quite a while, but when Tor gave away the whole series back in December leading up to *Come Tumbling Down's* release, I finally took the plunge.  I always loved the **October Daye** books, so I knew McGuire was a hell of a writer, but man, this one hits right in the feels.  I'm glad Tor put all of them out, because I *devoured* the whole series.  Another one that gets compared to Rowling, but it's like the anti-Harry Potter, and ten times better than that TERF-y bullshit.

**Row 2 - Card 1**

* **Ghost**  *Midnight Riot* by Ben Aaronovitch.  The **Rivers of London** series had been on my radar for a while, mostly popping up in ""like Dresden but not misogynist"" recs and the like, so I was aware of what I was getting into, more or less.  But man, what a good series.  Aaronovitch makes London feel like another character in the books and the plots move at a breakneck pace.  It's also nice to get in on the ground floor with a character just finding out about the spooky side, when a whole lot of urban fantasy starts out with the MC showing up badass from page one.
* **Exploration**  *The Long Earth* by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter (hard).  I had a couple other things that I was slotting into this square, but this one is an absolutely fantastic book.  I've read all of Discworld, but I'd never really looked too much at what Sir Pterry had done besides that, except for *Good Omens*.  I'm glad I picked this one up, and I'm (im)patiently waiting for the rest of the series to be available from the library.
* **Climate Fiction**  *Spinning Silver* by Naomi Novik (hard).  This one is another that I'd seen regularly pop up in rec threads, I'd just never gotten around to it.  I'd read a couple of the **Temeraire** books for previous cards, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Good book, very different from what I'd read from her before.  
* **Color in Title**  *The Blue Sword* by Robin McKinley (hard).  I just kinda stumbled upon this one, but I'm glad I did.  A fairly short and simple story, but with some real interesting interpretations of classic tropes.  It sometimes falls into the ""she's not like other girls"" trap, but it's a solid book.
* **Book Club**  *Empire of Sand* by Tasha Suri (hard).  I just happened to have this one pop up as available about a week into August, so I snagged it quickly and jumped into the discussion on the midway post.  It was...fine.  Not really my cup of tea, but fine.  

**Row 3 - Card 1**

* **Self Pubbed**  *Awaken Online: Catharsis* by Travis Bagwell.  I didn't even look up how many reviews this had, so it could've been hard mode for all I know, but screw Goodreads anyway.  This was a freebie giveaway back when the pandemic started and I bought a couple more in the series afterwards, but it's not really my cup of tea.  Waaaaay too LitRPG for me, for sure.
* **Epigraphs**  *FKA USA* by Reed King (hard).  I picked this up cold while waiting on a bunch of stuff on my holds list to come in, and I'm glad I did.  It's a travelogue through a dystopian post-apocalyptic wasteland, but, y'know, *hilarious*.  Like if *Into the Badlands* starred Seth Green. Or *The Road* was written by Christopher Moore instead of Cormac McCarthy.  I mean, who doesn't want to escape Little Rock for San Francisco with their robot girlfriend and talking goat, even if you do have to shoot it out with the Mormons to get across Utah?  The epigraphs, btw, are just part of the funny - it's also footnoted, and all of it supposedly sourced from the in-universe book *The Grifter's Guide to the Territories FKA USA*.  One of my faves this year.
* **Published in 2020**  *The Baron of Magister Valley* by Steven Brust.  I think I bought fewer books this year than I have in quite a while, since I was borrowing so many from the library.  This is one I pre-ordered, because I love Brust.  It's another Paarfi of Roundwood book, set in Brust's Dragaera universe, this time riffing on *The Count of Monte Cristo*.  I don't really read the Paarfi books for the plot, but even so, this one was kinda flimsy.  Still fun, but it seemed like Brust didn't really know what to do with the Mercedes expy, except make her slightly less helpless, which also made her less plot relevant.  I have a sneaking suspicion that she might come back 'round in the Vlad books, though.
* **School/University**  *Etiquette &amp; Espionage* by Gail Carriger (hard).  Love me a good steampunk ridiculosity.  And having young ladies go through a combination boarding school for society girls and training academy for secret agents on a freakin *airship* is just all kinds of fun.  I read practically everything Carriger has written over the summer, and found most of it eminently enjoyable.
* **Book About Books**  *Or What You Will* by Jo Walton (hard).  Oh my god, this book was sheer torture.  I *desperately* wanted to dig out my passport and fly to Florence after reading it, even though I'd never really considered a European vacation something I was interested in before.  But more than just a love letter to a location, this is a completely meta-everything book about a narrator living in an author's skull while she's writing a book that's an alternate history or maybe a meta-version of Shakespeare.  How Walton kept all of this straight in her *own* head is astoundingly impressive.

**Row 4 - Card 1**

* **Made You Laugh**  *Shakespeare for Squirrels* by Christopher Moore (hard).  This is the third book Moore's written featuring Pocket of Dog Snogging, his sidekick Drool, and a monkey named Jeff.  This time, Moore is sending up *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, with a decent amount of success.  All the classic bits are in there, with the guy with the ass's head, the love spells gone awry, Oberon and Titania, etc., but told with absolute irreverence and a dirty sense of humor.  Honestly, the first one, *Fool*, is still the best, but this one is better than *The Serpent of Venice*, which tried to combine Othello and the Merchant of Venice with less success.
* **Five Short Stories**  *Shadows and Reflections* ed. Trent Zelazny.  This was kind of a hit or miss collection for me, because the theme was authors writing a story set in the world of a Zelazny novel.  Whether I liked the story or not mostly depended on whether I'd read that particular novel, and there were quite a few that I apparently *haven't* read.  Some of the stories were clearly expecting me to have context that I lacked, but that just made me want to pick up the Zelazny novel they inspired, mostly.
* **Big Dumb Object**  *An Absolutely Remarkable Thing* by Hank Green (hard).  I thought that Hank Green was the guy who showed up on my Pandora station singing funny songs about physics and Star Trek, and then I found this book.  So then I looked him up, and he does, like, everything? Kinda like Cory Doctorow, I guess? Anyway, it's a good book about near future internet fame, sort of, but also about culture war and professional trolls.  There's lots of *very* recognizable things in there, in a somewhat chilling and depressing way.
* **Feminist**  *Dealing With Dragons* by Patricia Wrede.  I really like Wrede &amp; Stevermer's *Sorcery &amp; Cecelia* fantasy of manners books, so I thought I'd enjoy her take on the classic princess and the dragon trope.  I was right.  This is probably aimed more at the YA or maybe middle-grade level, but it was still a pleasant little book.  I'd have to doublecheck, but I'm pretty sure I used this as a palate cleanser after something like Harrow the Ninth.
* **Canadian**  *A Ghostly Request* by Krista D. Ball (hard).  I could've swapped in any of Krista's books that I read this year, but this one got the nod because it was the first one I read after bingo started.  Book 2 in the **Ladies Occult Society** series doesn't have as much occulting in it, but it's still a lot of fun.  I did miss the rest of the ladies in the society, though, and Lizzie's sisters drove me batshit.

**Row 5 - Card 1**

* **Number in Title**  *Six of Crows* by Leigh Bardugo.  Everybody was hyped for the Grishaverse, so I snagged them from the library.  Honestly, they were kinda meh.  The worldbuilding was fairly interesting, but the characters seemed like a group of dystopian teenagers played by 28 year olds.  Maybe it's just because part of my pandemic binging was stuff like *The 100* and the Hunger Games movies, but I just didn't really connect with the characters.
* **Romance**  *This Is How You Lose The Time War* by Amal al Mohtar and Max Gladstone.  Holy cow, this book.  Loved the prose, loved the emotion, loved the whole damn thing.  This one came along exactly when I needed it and it's easily one of my faves.
* **Magic Pet**  *Take a Thief* by Mercedes Lackey (hard).  I read just about every **Valdemar** book I could find this year, because they were solid comfort reads that I had never picked up before.  The Arrows series was quite good, but I'm using Skif's prequel book because he has Mindspeech, so his Companion actually talks in the book.
* **Graphic Novel**  I could put *Questionable Content* in this square every year, but usually I try to at least *look* for something different.  But screw it, it's QC by Jeph Jacques, I can't be bothered.
* **Politics**  *Star Wars: Aftermath* trilogy by Chuck Wendig (hard).  I read all three of his post-ROTJ Star Wars books, mostly because he wrote them, and they were fine.  I dunno, I read another Star Wars book last year for tie-in by Daniel Jose Older, who I also like, but I'm getting the impression that Star Wars books aren't for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, that took *waaay*  too long to write up each individual book.  I'm going to post Card 2 just as titles and a blurb.  If you have a specific question about a book, post it below.

**Row 1 - Card 2**

* **Translated:** *War of the Dwarves* by Markus Heitz. Sequel to the book above.

* **Optimistic:** *A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor* by Hank Green (hard). Sequel to BDO above.
* **Featuring Necromancy:** *The Servant's Tower* by Scott Warren. Same world as *The Dragon's Banker*, which I liked better, but it's a magical SWAT team.
* **Ace/Aro:** *Artificial Condition* by Martha Wells (hard). Murderbot FOREVAH.

**Row 2 - Card 2**

* **Ghost:** *Lies Sleeping* by Ben Aaronovitch.  Another Rivers of London book, very good.
* **Exploration:** *The Girl With All The Gifts* by M.R. Carey.  Interesting take on the zombie novel.
* **Climate Fiction:** *The Calculating Stars* by Mary Robinette Kowal.  I definitely intend to read the rest of the Lady Astronaut books.
* **Color:** *The Green Rider* by Kristen Britain (hard). I was apparently on a magic horse kick this summer.
* **Book Club:** *The Bone Witch* by Rin Chupeco. I honestly don't remember much of this one, but I DNF'd the sequel.

**Row 3 - Card 2**

* **Self-pubbed:** *Blood Tally* by Brian McClellan. Next book in his **Valkyrie Collections** series.
* **Epigraphs:** *Daggerspell* by Katharine Kerr (hard).  Didn't like this one very much.

* **School:** *A Deadly Education* by Naomi Novik (hard). Lives up to the hype, can't wait for the sequel.
* **Book about Books:** *The Forbidden Library* by Django Wexler.  Pretty good series, but I liked Shadow Campaigns better.

**Row 4 - Card 2**

* **Made You Laugh:** *So You Had To Build A Time Machine* by Jason Offutt.  What do you get when you mix a kid who ran *away* from the circus, a haunted house, and particle physics? A freakin mess.
* **5 Short Stories:**
   * ""A Guide for Working Breeds"" by Vina Jie-Min Prasad - loved it.
   * ""Open House on Haunted Hill"" by John Wiswell - sweet story
   * ""It's A Beautiful Day On The Internet, and You Are A Horrible Bot"" by Aimee Ogden - funny
   * ""The Case of the Somewhat Mythic Sword"" by Garth Nix - intriguing
   * ""The Ransom of Miss Coraline Connelly"" by Alix E. Harrow - her short stuff is so good.
* **Big Dumb Object:** *Blacklight Express* by Phillip Reeve (hard).  Liked both of these books.
* **Feminist:** *Flash Gold* by Lindsay Buroker.  Part of her Yukon novellas, not my favorite of hers.
* **Canadian:** *Knight Shift* by Krista D. Ball.  Part of Krista's Newfie series.

But anyway here is my card and some short thoughts if anyone is interested!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel translated from original language: The Time of Contempt (Andrzej Sapkowski)**

Rating: 3/5 

Something about this book never quite clicked with me, on the face of it it’s exactly the type of story I usually love but I always felt as though something was holding me back from enjoying it and honestly I’m still not sure what it was. I was able to enjoy listening to this book, it was a nice escape for a while, but nothing really hooked me in and made me want more. I plan to continue the series so hopefully I’ll be able to appreciate it a bit more down the line. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Setting featuring snow, ice or cold: The Sword of Kaigen (M.L. Wang)** 

Rating: 3.5/5

I was so looking forward to reading this after seeing how much praise it received and the amount of times I saw it recommended here. I was left feeling so conflicted after it, parts of this I absolutely loved; the character development, the magic, the general feel of the book throughout and one of the best set pieces I’ve read in the middle of the novel. However, I just couldn’t let myself go enough to be absorbed into it, I think in part to the info dumps at the beginning and the constant changing of time increments which (albeit a tiny irritation) were just enough to throw me off a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel with Chapter Epigraphs: The Calculating Stars (Mary Robinette Kowal)**

Rating: 2/5

Yet another book I was looking forward to reading, it has been sitting on my TBR for so long I was glad to finally get an opportunity to get to it. I was quite disappointed with The Calculating Stars, once I finished I just had this feeling of an itch that was *nearly* scratched but just didn’t quite get there. This one just wasn’t for me personally. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel featuring Necromancy: Sabriel (Garth Nix)**

Rating 2.5/5

An interesting story, I’m generally a sucker for anything necromancy related so I loved the idea of this and I loved the magic system. For me, I found the writing a bit dry at times and the pacing a bit random. I enjoyed it, but won’t be reaching for the sequels. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Ace/Aero Spec Fic: Vicious (V.E. Schwab)** 

Rating: 4.5/5

I loved this story, I actually knew nothing about it before I read it and picked it up purely because it fit this square and others spoke quite highly of it and I am so glad I did. The whole idea behind the story and the powers themselves were so intriguing and well written. I was glad it wasn’t just a typical good vs bad kind of story and actually explored the morality of characters and how a human would respond to having these wild powers. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel featuring a ghost: The Curse of Chalion (Lois McMaster-Bujold)**

Rating: 4/5 

Another book I had never heard of prior to this bingo card and ever since I read it I have been kicking myself for not knowing about it before. This was well-written, interesting and mysterious throughout; I spent the whole time trying to guess at what was actually happening or what might happen only to be proven so delightfully wrong. One of my favourite reads of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel featuring exploration: The Children of Time (Adrian Tchaikovsky)** 

Rating: 5/5

If you told me that I could read about, and sympathise with, a bunch of spiders before I read this I honestly would have laughed in your face. This was an incredible piece of work from start to finish, from the ingenuity of the world-building, the evident amount of research into spiders and their capabilities and how that could then be translated into the fantastical, the dichotomous presentation of the spiders vs the humans throughout the novel. Honestly the only fault I can think of with this book is that I almost got a spider as a pet before I realised what I was doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Climate Fiction: The Fifth Season (N.K. Jemisin)** 

Rating: 4.5/5

The only reason this book isn’t getting a full 5/5 is purely due to some of the writing style. I loved everything about this book but the 2nd person narrative just threw me a bit. Aside from that though, my oh my, what a book. Great characters, great magic system, great exploration of ideas and politics, really gripping in pretty much every aspect. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel with a colour in the title: The Priory of the Orange Tree (Samantha Shannon)**

Rating: 3.5/5

I loved mostly everything about this book, despite some flaws I couldn’t put it down and found myself devouring the whole thing in a few sittings. However, pacing was a huge issue for me with this; the book spent so long going through small things in a lot of detail or spending a lot of time on characters that didn’t serve the plot at all and yet the ending was so rushed I actually had to go back over it to see did I miss something. I would definitely read again but yeah, pacing toward the end was a bit jarring. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Self-Published Novel: Unsouled (Will Wight)** 

Rating: 2.5/5

I wasn’t a massive fan of Unsouled to be honest. I see it recommended everywhere and it’s spoken of so highly I thought ‘this must be good,’ but I just felt a bit let down with it. I enjoyed the magic and I enjoyed the characters but I just kind of felt like I knew exactly what was going to happen very soon into the book and, well, I did. I have since persisted and finished the rest of the series and I love the rest, I think the series gets progressively better so I’m glad I stuck with it after Unsouled. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel published in 2020: Rhythm of War (Brandon Sanderson)** 

Rating: 4/5

A lot has already been said about this book here already so I won’t spend too much time on it. I felt there were some pacing issues and the book was definitely a tad longer than it needed to be in parts but generally speaking I loved this book. Not my favourite entry so far in this series but definitely great nonetheless. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Optimistic Spec Fic: The House on the Cerulean Sea (T.J. Klune)**

Rating: 5/5

Hands down my favourite book of the year. Such an incredible, heart-warming story which was exactly what I needed at the time I read it. It’s exactly the type of book that can make you change your outlook on the world and how you relate to others and just give you that bit of hope that maybe everything’s alright and the world isn’t a clusterfuck of shit from every angle. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel set in school/uni: Red Sister (Mark Lawrence)** 

Rating: 2.5/5

I read the opening line and I was ready for loving this; badass nuns with entire armies needed to kill them...eh yes please! Unfortunately I don’t think the book delivered as much as it could have. I loved the world and the characters but the writing and pacing of the book let me down; I think there was too much training and educational parts for me personally that I just found myself reading it to get to the next part rather than being lost in it. I feel like a traitor because everyone else seems to love this book but it just wasn’t for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Book about books: The Ten Thousand Doors of January (Alix E. Harrow)** 

Rating: 4.5/5

Another absolutely fantastic story from start to finish. I kind of suspected how it was all going to end before I got there but I just didn’t care; if anything it made me more keen to finish it in this case. I loved the characters and the idea of all the different worlds, the only annoying thing about the worlds were the ones that were mentioned briefly but we didn’t get to see and explore. I loved January as a protagonist almost immediately and I was so glad to see she got the ending she did. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **A book that made you laugh: Mort (Terry Pratchett)**

Rating: 4/5

This was my first Discworld novel. Why have I never touched Discworld before you might ask? I’m an idiot, that’s why. This is exactly my type of humor and I don’t think I could love Death more if I tried. I listened to this book and it just added to it so much; it’s an old recording for anyone thinking about getting it but so well done. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Five Short Stories: The Merry Spinster (Daniel M. Lavery)** 

Rating: 2/5

I just couldn’t like this collection, I spent most of the time trying to figure out which story was based on which fairy tale and even when I did figure it I was left wanting in how they were portrayed. The writing was excellent and I would be very keen to read something else by them. 

&amp;#x200B;

* r/Fantasy **book club: The City in the Middle of the Night (Charlie Jane Anders)**

Rating: 2/5

This book was incredibly frustrating. It held so much promise with fantastic and creative ideas but the execution just wasn’t great. All the characters felt underdeveloped with relationships that were mostly just frustrating to read and the plot and structure were a bit all over the place for me. I’d love to read some more of Charlie Jane Anders' work because I loved the ideas, just not the book itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Romantic Fantasy: This Is How You Lose The Time War (Amal El-Mohtar, Max Gladstone)**

Rating: 4.5/5

This was an incredible book. It took me a while to get into it I think because the prose and the structure of the book took some getting used to but oh my when I finished it I was so annoyed it wasn’t longer. The relationship was simply beautiful and, although it annoyed me initially, I was so glad the book didn’t focus on all of the background factions or the war or anything because it left the focus entirely on the relationship. Definitely one of my favourite reads of this card and highly recommended. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Big Dumb Object: The Three Body Problem (Cixin Liu)**

Rating: 3/5

This was just alright for me, had some interesting ideas but large portions of the book I struggled to maintain interest in. I didn’t really connect with a lot of the characters in a way that made me want to keep reading about them. I’ve heard the next few entries are improvements on this so they will remain on my TBR. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel with a magical pet: The Empress of Salt and Fortune (Nghi Vo)** 

Rating: 3/5

I’ll be honest I can’t remember a lot of what happens in this story; there have been so many books between reading this and now. I do remember enjoying it and hoping it would be a bit longer, and I do remember liking the way the story was told. It’s actually on my TBR to read again so I can remind myself about everything in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Audiobook: The Shadow Rising (Robert Jordan)** 

Rating: 4.5/5

I actually listened to the whole of Wheel of Time throughout 2020 and couldn’t decide which to use for this square so the fairest way was to use the first one that fell within the Bingo time. I can’t believe I had never experienced the Wheel of Time before now it was an incredible journey. Yes the series has some flaws and some difficult portions to get through but as a whole this has been placed high on my list of all time favourites and I actually have to thank Bingo because if I didn’t have other books to read to complete the card I would have jumped straight into rereading this. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel with a number in the title: Slaughterhouse Five (Kurt Vonnegut Jr.)** 

Rating: 4/5

I loved this book although it did take me a while to get into it, once I did I couldn’t put it down. I loved the non-linear writing style, the ideas presented and how they were dealt with and how personal the writing came across. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel featuring politics: Jade City (Fonda Lee)** 

Rating: 5/5

On paper this book had everything I wanted in a novel and more. Thankfully it delivered on every promise and more, definitely one the best novels I’ve read this year and Jade War has been moved right up to the top of my TBR. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Novel by a Candian author: Children of Earth and Sky (Guy Gavriel Kay)**

Rating: 4/5

The only reason I wouldn’t give this 5/5 is purely because of how hard I found it to get into. The prose, albeit beautiful, was difficult for me to get used to but once I did that was me fully immersed. I’ve heard that this isn’t Kay’s best book either so I can’t wait to read the rest of their work.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Feminist Novel: The Handmaid’s Tale (Margaret Atwood)**

Rating: 4.5/5

I absolutely loved this book, everything felt so visceral in it and Atwood did a great job of bringing the reader into the world. The ideas and how they relate to the world now made me challenge myself and consider perspectives I had previously been aware of but hadn’t spent a lot of time contemplating, a fantastic novel through and through."

739,Fantasy,I've got Emberblade Audiobook Codes to Give Away,"Hey all, 

A little while ago, the mods kindly allowed me to tell you about a publishing deal for The Landkist Saga, new editions, new artwork, and most importantly, new audiobooks narrated by The Witcher's Peter Kenny.

*Processing img qveevc41zln61...*

**The very, very brief sales pitch for The Landkist Saga is that it follows a group of bold elemental warriors struggling to survive in the midst of the War of Sages, focusing in particular on the last Embers, flame-wielding warriors who may hold the key to stopping the war between immortals once and for all.** 

**The series has been described as a blend between Avatar: The Last Airbender, Princess Mononoke and The Legend of Zelda by readers and reviewers.** 

[Listen to a sample here](https://www.audible.com/pd/Emberblade-Audiobook/B08Z2S4465?).

Today, I'm happy to announce that I've got audio codes to give away for both the US and UK stores. 

I've got bunches of codes. Absolute bunches of them for both the US and UK Audible stores. Winning r/Fantasy members will be contacted via DM with their code and instructions on how to claim it.

\--

If you'd like to be considered for one, please participate in this fun little game:

My favorite fantasy trope basically boils down to, ""group of powerful badasses."" I like strong main characters, but I also like having a group possessed of varied abilities, personalities and power levels, which is probably owing to my childhood and teenage obsession with Dragon Ball Z, Dragonlance, the Fellowship from LOTR, etc. 

Below, please post an explanation of your favorite group of badasses from the fantasy genre, and highlight one character in particular you liked, either from a personality or action perspective. I'll allow this definition to stretch to anime, manga, comic books, etc. Just try to focus it on warriors, fighters, magic-users, etc. 

(At the end of your little post, please include a tag that says either ""US Store"" or ""UK Store"" so I know which code to DM you if you're chosen."

742,Fantasy,Sequence Complete: The Long Price Quartet by Daniel Abraham,"Centuries ago the Old Empire fell to a civil war, destroyed by the sorcerers known as poets, wielding the powers of ideas given human form and volition, the *andat*. Whilst the empire was destroyed, the colony-states across the ocean survived and became the cities of the Khaiem, where the power of the *andat* continues to hold sway and hold rival nations, such as expansionist Galt, in check. The Khaiem are subtle (relying on a complex courtly language of poses) but also ruthless in trade and in the defence of their riches.

Otah Machi was once a student of the poets, but when given the choice to study for entrance to the order he refused and went on the run, refusing to return to his noble home for fear of what chaos it would wreck in the order of succession. Instead, his path takes him south to the city of Saraykeht, a city whose riches are based on the cotton trade, strengthened as it is by the activities of the poet Heshai and his *andat*, Seedless. Meanwhile, another student of the poets also arrives in Saraykeht on an important mission. Both men become embroiled in a chilling conspiracy designed to destroy the power of the *andat* once and for all.

**The Long Price Quartet** (2006-09) was Daniel Abraham's first published series-length work, an epic fantasy in which war, love, treachery, intrigue and hubris are studied and examined in depth.  Abraham's series focuses more on the motivations of his protagonists rather than the trappings of the setting, but the ""magic system"" describing the relationship between the poets and the *andat* is a key part of the story.

The series rotates through four seasons - *A Shadow in Summer*, *A Betrayal in Winter*, *An Autumn War* and *The Price of Spring* \- but spans many, many years. The quartet explores the relationship between Otah and Maati, characters from different backgrounds who forge a relationship that spans their lives, with years and sometimes decades falling between each book. The characters evolve over time, sometimes standing as allies and sometimes as opponents, until the onset of an apocalypse overturns their preconceptions and forces them to work together.

This is something of a melancholy series, one less interested in massive battles and displays of sorcery (both are present, but distinctly under-emphasised compared to other series) than it is in character motivations and relationships. There is much introspection, especially in the final volume set late in the main characters' lives, where they struggle with the weight of history (the world's and their own). Abraham is a gifted writer of character, not interested in one-note depiction of either the (flawed) heroes or the (sometimes well-meaning) villains.

**The Long Price Quartet** is the quietest but most emotionally devastating of Abraham's works. His later **Dagger and the Coin** series is more conventional epic fantasy, his **Black Sun's Daughter** series (as MLN Hanover) is urban fantasy and his **Expanse** series (as James SA Corey, along with Ty Franck) is epic space opera. But **The Long Price** may remain his masterwork, an understated and elegant story of hope and loss against a backdrop of political intrigue and, later, war. Reminiscent of Guy Gavriel Kay at his very best, **The Long Price** is an underrated but hugely rewarding series.

The series is available now in two omnibus editions: *Shadow and Betrayal* and *Seasons of War* (sometimes published as *The Price of War*)."

*Quick warning :* to all you Brits and Americans who will not understand how I'm in direct contact with a publisher and not a litterary agent, as it's custom : I'm French and I'm writing in French, and things happen straight between the writer and the publisher here, no middle-man.

Anyways

So, around six months ago, I've sent my book (a sci-fi / fantasy adventure) to various publishers and today I finally received an answer for one relatively small publishing house I was really eager to work with.

And yeah... *""Unfortunately, your manuscript didnt manage to convince the entirety of our reading comity. Thus, we cannot envision its publication.""*

As you can guess, not the best thing to wake up to. It kinda brings the mood down for the day. Naturally. Oh, I'll get over it, but I was really eager to work with these guys.

Still, I sent a mail back, asking if it was possible to have some more feedback and criticism...

And they obliged (that's really nice of them, they truly didnt have to).

**- The story lacks action sequences.**

**- Too many characters, which can be confusing.**

**- The ending feels strange and rushed.**

**- That being said, they found the overall story and the writing style quite pleasing.**

I mostly wanted to share my experience and vent my deception with that post, but to also say that if it's in any way possible to have some feedback from a publisher who rejected you, go for it. Best thing to help you grow and get better.

Wishing you an amazing day, guys !

Now go back to your story !"
750,Fantasy,Predictions/Hopes/Fears about Netflix's Redwall?,"What are you guys hoping to see from the recently announced Netflix Redwall? What do you think it will be like?

I know a guy called Patrick McHale is writing it. His previous projects seem well regarded, but employ the ""CalArts style"". I can only assume that it will be taken as read that that won't even slightly fit Redwall. I don't think he's directing, just writing.

Exec producer is the woman who did the Peter Rabbit film (name escapes me). That film was meh, but if she's only the producer then it should be fine, as long as they don't use the godawful CGI PR used. Rustic 2D please. Also this hopefully means that they will be having a British voice cast, as is only right. Redwall is a very British series and American voices would feel out of place.

All in all, I'm very hopeful. What about you guys?"

756,Fantasy,I completed the 2020/21 Bingo Challenge! Here are my final reviews!,"Hello for the last time on this topic /r/Fantasy. It's been a wonderful year of adventure for me. This was my first bingo challenge and it was such a blessing being able to read new and unusual books I would have never read without this bingo list. There was only one problem, and that is that I now have so many sequals and series to read that I will have to sit out next year! [bingo 5 reviews are here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/l5uaax/i_got_my_fifth_bingo_line_on_the_rfantasy_bingo/) and you can find the links in each of the previous bingo reviews for the previous ones. 
 
 This line will be the top horizontal one, minus the Optomistic spec which was reviewed in my first bingo line. Let's get started:

  
 **1. Novel translated from it's original language: The Last Wish -  Anderzej Sapkowski** - I was worried about this book starting out because a lot of reviews online say that it is dated, cancelled, misogynistic, and other not so nice things, but I have to say that I quite enjoyed the book. I am a big witcher 3 videogame fan and I enjoyed the Witcher series on Netflix as well so a lot of the stories and lore from the videogame and show are present in the book, and it's just more Geralt adventure fun! The book is a collection of short stories interspliced by Geralt recovering from a neck wound in a monetary.  Each story is a fun take on a fantasy monster and a nice look into the life of a Witcher. I liked how Geralt handles each mission, and his way of thinking. Overall I enjoyed this book, I might continue the Witcher series of books, but they'll be low on the list since there are so many other very exciting books to keep reading!
 
 **2. Setting featuring snow, ice, or cold: The Bear and the Nightingale - Katherine Arden** - Holy shit guys, this book takes the cake for this bingo line. It really wasn't what I expected since I didn't read anything about this book before starting it. It takes place in medieval russia and involves a lot of russian folklore, which I know nothing about but the book does a great job introducing it. The book's protagonist is a young woman who has 'special sight', which makes her able to see and speak with spirits that protect and care for her village and the nature surrounding it. This writing is top level guys, and I really recommend this book to anyone who wants to be swept away in the story, deep characters, great prose, and incredibly interesting themes. Old traditions vs new religions, invading idealism fighting against established cultures/powers. This story is great and hits you hard. I loved it. 
 
 **3. Optimistic Spec Fic: The Emperor's Soul - Brandon Sanderson** - I reviewed this in my very first bingo line. I did my first line vertically, which I quickly realised I didn't want to do, so you can find this review [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/giudt6/i_got_my_first_bingo_on_rfantasy_and_im_here_to/), but to sum it up, it was a short story and it was a fun read. 
 
 **4. Novel featuring necromancy: Sabriel - Garth Nix** - This is the story of a young girl who comes from the 'old kingdom' of the north and has some magical powers. Her father has gone missing and she returns to the old kingdom to track him down and rediscover her roots. Overall the book was good and the story moves along quickly, but it didn't hit me as much as the other books in this line. I found myself wanting to skim over some of the descriptions, and the main character spends too much time by herself that it made me feel bored. I guess I'm just a sucker for dialogue rather than description of actions and sights. I still enjoyed the characters, and the overall story was very interesting and it had a nice conclusion. 
 
 **5. ~~Ace/Aro Spec Fic~~ Cyberpunk: Ghost in the shell graphic novel - Masamune Shirou** - This was a replacement square because I really wanted to read some cyberpunk (Yes, I was excited about the game) and I am a huge GITS fan but had never read the original manga series, and this was a great opportunity to do so. I also couldn't find an Ace/Aro book that interested me, but hopefully I'll find one in the future and give it a shot. The replacement square was between this square or a romance book, I ended up choosing this one. Anyway, GITS has come a long way since the original series, and that is a good thing. The original manga is very hard to follow and super confusing. The artwork is amazing and the characters are all still very strong and cool, but the story is all over the place, doesn't explain anything, and sometimes I wasn't even sure I was reading the story in the correct order (and I live in Japan so have a lot of experience reading manga!). If it was my first dive into the series I would have been really turned off by it, but since I knew basically everything that was happening and the world of GITS I actually enjoyed seeing all the original stuff and how much the characters have changed over the years. Batou and the Major are among my favorite characters in fiction, and the relationship Kusanagi has with her identity is incredibly thought provoking. her inner turmoil is a cornerstone of the genre and it is something future SF writers have been inspired by. This was worth the ride, but that ride was rather confusing, so be warned. 
 
 This bingo line ranking: 
 
 1. The Bear and the Nightingale - Katherine Arden
 
 2. The Last Wish - Anderzej Sapkowski
 
 3. Ghost in the Shell - Masamune Shirou
 
 4. The Emperor's Soul - Brandon Sanderson
 
 5. Sabriel - Garth Nix
 
 The top 5 books that I read from all 25 books are: 
 
 
 1 The Sarantine Mosaic - Guy Gavriel Kay 
 
 2 A Wizard of Earthsea - Ursula K. Guin
 
 3 The Ten Thousand Doors of January - Alix E. Harrow
 
 4 The Bear and the Nightingale - Katherine Arden
 
 5 The Sparrow - Mary Doria Rusell **OR** Ringworld - Niven
 
  
Well that's it from me! I just wanted to say thankyou to the people who organize these bingo cards and the community for recommending so many great and I just wanted to say that it was a great  experinece  being able to read so many interesting books that I wouldn't have picked up if it were not for this bingo list. I'm excited to continue reading  the series that I started  during this bingo list (like  Wizard of earthsea, The roibin hobb assassins series, the fifth season books, more Guy Gavriel Kay books,  and more discworld). I'll see you guys in a few years for another round of bingo challenge!  love you all."
757,Fantasy,My first Bingo Card (with mini-Reviews!),"I tried to do Bingo last year and never finished, so my goal was to actually complete it this year. I think every single book qualifies for Hard Mode, and I posted lengthier reviews on my Goodreads and personal Facebook to count for Hero Mode. Short thoughts and star ratings are below!

https://preview.redd.it/fl4h4ti6din61.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=696e7e3c1e3b7072a39c4234c2e15f598ae9c665

**Row 1:**

1. **Translated. The Queue.** Satire of a Middle Eastern security state. I hate security states and love satire, but somehow it didn't work for me. I didn't find it funny or interesting, but I appreciate what the author was trying to do. 2/5
2. **Ice/cold/snow. The Left Hand of Darkness.** My first LeGuin novel. I think it aged very well! Very thought-provoking, with a lot of potential discussion to be had from such a short tale. 5 stars
3. **Optimistic. Miranda in Milan.** A queer sequel in which Miranda gets the agency she never received from Shakespeare's original. Nice and feel-good, if a bit simple. 4/5
4. **Necromancer. Harrow the Ninth.** OMFG. Nothing else to say here. 10 stars
5. **Ace/Aro. Every Heart a Doorway.** Beautiful homage to anyone who has ever wanted to escape into a fairy tale world. 5 stars

**Row 2:**

1. **Ghost. The Girl from the Well.** I love horror. It started out scary, but the plot seemed to lose its way about halfway through the story. 3/5
2. **Exploration. The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet.** Plot takes a backseat to the really empathetic and uplifting character journey. Most feel-good book of the year. 4/5 stars
3. **Climate. The Summer Queen.** Very ambitious, even if it doesn't always live up to expectations. Great characterization. 4/5
4. **Color in Title. Greenwode.** Beautiful queer fairy tale retelling. Will rip your heart out. Very dense, but full of exquisitely beautiful prose. 5 stars
5. **Book Club. The Haunting of Tram Car 015**. Cool setting, but I didn't love the plot. Felt overly long for a novella, which is a little disappointing. 3/5

&amp;#x200B;

**Row 3:**

1. **Self-published. The Last Everything.** Got it free on Kindle. Hated it and only finished it because I was running out of time for Book Bingo. 1/5
2. **Chapter Epigraphs. Rhythm of War.** I love Sanderson and I love Stormlight Archive. Not as good as Book 3, but still very good. A little too long. 4.5 stars
3. **Published in 2020. The Unspoken Name.** Cool setting, slightly messy plot, but I loved the protagonist. Picked up a lot after part 1, so I will definitely read the sequel. 3.5 stars
4. **School/University. Red Sister.** Bloody and brilliant. Loved the inventive setting. Loved the writing style. Loved the characters. 5 stars
5. **Substituted Square: Vampire novel (hard mode: protagonist). Interview with the Vampire.** Not as scary as I wanted, but still intriguing. The writing style was interesting at first but began to drag halfway through the book. It's a classic so I'm still glad I read it. 3/5 stars

**Row 4:**

1. **Made you Laugh. Redshirts.** Actually laughed out loud multiple times. Hysterical concept. Did not love the ending, but will definitely read more Scalzi. 4/5 stars
2. **Short stories. Sooner or Later Everything Falls into the Sea.** Hard to rate; lots of really good stories but a few duds. Loved ""And Then There Were N-One"" and ""Wind Will Rove"".
3. **Big Dumb Object. Children of Time.** I hate spiders and I still loved this. Really cool exploration of what it means to be human. 5 stars
4. **Feminist. Parable of the Sower.** I had never heard of Octavia Butler before joining this sub. So glad I discovered her! Really cool concept; a ""mid-apocalyptic"" rather than post-apocalyptic novel. Great characters but sometimes I felt the pace was too slow for me. 4/5 stars
5. **Canadian author. Necropolis.** Laugh-out-loud dark humor that was exactly my style. Weird genre mashup between film (book?) noire, horror, and comedy. Already bought the sequel. 5 stars

**Row 5:** 

1. **Number in the Title. Six-Gun Snow White.** The hardest of hard modes to find. I love fairy tale retellings and this was a cool concept. The dialogue was excellent without being overbearing. 4/5 stars
2. **Romance. The Cybernetic Tea Shop.** Very sweet, but I couldn't get over the part where the human protagonist operates on her girlfriend's brain and doesn't see an ethical issue with this. 3/5 stars
3. **Magical Pet. Magic's Pawn.** Fun YA story. Wish I had this when I was a closeted gay kid in the South. Kind of hokey and overly emotional, but hey, that's what being a teenager is like, right? 4/5 stars
4. **Audio Drama. The Bright Sessions.** X-Men go to therapy. Awesome concept. Everyone could use some therapy after this year. The season 3 finale made me literally clench my steering wheel until my hands turned white. 5 stars
5. **Politics. The Traitor Baru Cormarant (and sequels).** Book 1 broke my heart. Definitely my favorite of the three, but book 3 gave it a run for its money. Dickinson has created a brilliant and immersive world with a flawed protagonist that you still want to love. 5 stars"

765,Fantasy,Review: The Stolen Kingdom by Jillian Boehme (x-post r/YAlit),"[***The Stolen Kingdom***](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53205978-the-stolen-kingdom?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=PeMRnGjsL0&amp;rank=1) (March 2021) by Jillian Boehme is a stand-alone YA fantasy novel about the heirs of two families who find their paths entangled by the political machinations and magical legacies of their forbears.

Maralyth Graylaern ('Mara' to her friends) is the daughter of a vintner in the kingdom of Perin Faye. Though she uses her secret magical talents to increase the yield of their harvests, her family is struggling under the excessive tithes of the Thungrave king. Despite her caution, her magic comes to the attention of a scheming lord who understands the implications of her natural-born powers, and kidnaps her to force her involvement in a coup attempt. Prince Alac, the second son of the king, is troubled by the dark effects of his own family's magical power, which was stolen through blood magic from the previous dynasty. Despite his lack of ambition to the throne (he'd really rather study winemaking and set up a vineyard somewhere away from court once his older brother inherits), his accidental discovery of Mara's magic leads him to realize that the two of them have a means to potentially fix the rot—both magical and non-magical—at the heart of the kingdom.

Mara's and Alac's perspectives alternate, and in the Recorded Books audiobook version, their chapters are voiced respectively by Suzy Jackson and Kirby Heyborne. Both were straightforward, satisfactory narrators, though neither imbued their characters with more than a minimum of personality or emotion. I would have liked to hear them make the characters their own a little more, as it would have added a lot to the book.

Though I was initially discouraged by the slow pacing at the start, the plot really picked up in the second half. Mara and Alac, both likeable and interesting characters, take an instant shine to each other when they meet at court, and their relationship has a satisfactory arc that manages to convey their mutual attraction without being an unbelievable love-at-first-sight scenario. There's definitely a light romance plotline, but it plays second, or possibly third, fiddle to the political plot and their quest to understand what's going on with magic in Perin Faye.

My biggest complaint is that the magic is pretty simplistic, for all the mystery with which it is initially presented. The book is slow to reveal much of any interest that can be done with the magic, and the explanation of how it works or where it came from is relatively lacking. While there is a lot of discussion about how stolen magic is corrupted and corrupting, no such consideration is given to the question of why any royal line should have all the magical power (and the right to it). Divine right is a time-honored fantasy trope, but I'm always hoping to see a more modern take on it. Also, I was hoping for a lot more detail about winemaking and the potential application of magic in the process, considering it's a common interest of the two main characters.

Overall, a decent read, though probably one that I would have enjoyed more as a teenager.

767,Fantasy,Wheel of Time takes forever to translate. Need help to write complaint email,"Hello! I need help to write an email regarding the way a book publisher from my country has mishandled the translation of the ""Wheel of Time"" series.

The first volume was translated in 2001. They recently released volume 9. I think they're at the point where they release a new volume every few years to not lose the rights to the translation.

Only in the last 7 years, at no point were all the translated volumes available for purchase. I assume it was similar before that, but can't say for sure since I didn't know the series existed until then.

Until volume 8 came out, one could find volume 1 and 2 only at second hand. Those weren't available even on their own page.

After volume 8 came out, one couldn't find volume 4, 5. They did the courtesy of reprinting the first two volumes after years of them being unavailable, only to discard the ones mentioned before.

Now that volume 9 came out, one can't (oddly) find volume 2 and 4.

All (available) volumes are available for purchase on their site at a discount of 47% because no one bothers to buy the books since we all lost hope they'll finish them.

They don't respond to inquiries regarding these problems, they ignore emails and the only instances they speak about the series is once in a blue moon, when they release a new volume.

Unless the upcoming TV show isn't the next GoT, I doubt they'll finish translating the series in less than 10 years (and I'm being optimistic).

They really don't care and I'd want to write an email of complaint regarding the mistreatment of the series translation so that maybe someone will do something and other publishers will have the chance of starting from scratch. I just don't know where.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!"

769,Fantasy,Looking for an adult contemporary fantasy,"Been on a weird lit/contemporary fantasy/urban fantasy/dark academia kick. Have loved books like Ninth House, The Library at Mount Char, the Rook, Vicious/Vengeful, etc. But I seem to have hit a rut. Looking for something that checks these boxes:

1) Magic/Secret Societies/Gods/Superpowers/Etc but in our regular modern world. Nothing written before the early 2000s, please! 

2) PLEASE NOTHING WITH SO MUCH EXPOSITION. My biggest complaint with fantasy is those books that spend ages and ages explaining every detail, all the locations and the inner workings of every little thing. I don't care. I just wanna be enveloped in the story right away. It drives me nuts! 

3) Please no vampires, lol. Not super interested-- if they're sort of secondary like in the Rook, that's fine, but nothing that focuses on that please. 

4) Not YA. I really want adults or twenty-somethings messing around, not children. Something that doesn't fade to black when it gets real. 

I would love if it was darker and maybe included some sex or gruesome fight scenes, but that's not necessary if the book is otherwise excellent. Would love a secondary romance plot (ie in Ninth House with Darlington/Alex) but again, not needed. 

Please let me know if you've got anything!! Thank you so much in advance!!"
770,Fantasy,"One Mike to Read them All: Advance review of ""The Galaxy, and the Ground Within"" by Becky Chambers","Becky Chambers is balm for the soul.

This is the final Wayfarers book, and if you’ve read any of the previous ones, you have a good idea of what to expect here. If you haven’t, what you’re going to get isn’t a book with a ton of plot. This book is *all* about characters.

This time around, we have a few people at a highway rest stop when a major accident means the roads are closed and they’re stuck there for a few days. Just all space-y, because this is a sci fi story. They all have reasons to be anxious to be gone. They’ve all got schedules to keep, appointments to make, people they care about they are eager to see again. And they’re stuck waiting around, with no one for company but each other and the woman (along with her teenage son) who runs the place.

As in *A Closed and Common Orbit* and *A Record of a Spaceborn Few*, we get a connection back to the crew of the Wayfarer in the first book without actually seeing any of them. In this case, one of the people stuck waiting is Ashby’s Aeluon girlfriend.


Interestingly, none of the people waiting are human. We get one human making a brief appearance, but otherwise this book is all aliens.

Pei is returning from the front lines of the war against the titular small, angry planet from the first book. She’s on her way to meet Ashby, and emotionally exhausted from the sneaking about required by her species’ taboo against interspecies relationships.

Roveg is a Quellin (Rosemary described them as lobster-centaurs), but has been exiled from his homeworld for not sharing their xenophobia. He’s returning to Quellin space to apply for a visitor’s permit, and is understandably eager and reluctant both to get on with his journey.

Speaker is an Akarak, a race forced to live a nomadic life and generally looked down on as thieves and pirates by the more respectable citizens of the Galactic Commons. Because of this distrust, Speaker isn’t comfortable interacting with anyone but her twin sister, and Speaker being stuck on the surface with no communications while her sister is in orbit (with the big accident and all) has her more than a little upset.

Ouloo who runs the rest stop wants everyone to feel comfortable and welcomed, and she is very determined in this regard.

Her son Tupo is a teenager who mostly wants to eat and ask endless questions.

They talk. They get to know one another. They share stresses and hopes and stories. There’s some drama that has me worried. And then the roads are cleared, they all move on (with heartfelt promises to stop at Ouloo’s again whenever they’re passing by) a bit wiser.

It is, as I said, balm for the soul. It comes out on April 20th."
771,Fantasy,"Offering a +1 for ""A Thief in Farshore"" by Justin Fike","Not sure where I ran across the Farshore Chronicles ([https://www.goodreads.com/series/269946-the-farshore-chronicles](https://www.goodreads.com/series/269946-the-farshore-chronicles)) - I don't \*think\* I've seen them mentioned on this sub - but I've read the first four books and have been impressed.  The first book (of six) is rated 4.25 on Goodreads, and the ratings keep increasing as the series progresses.  As such, I wanted to give y'all a heads up and recommendation to check them out.

The good:

* Interesting world created, with its own culture and even its own vernacular
* Memorable characters who are distinct from each other in personality, habits, and speech
* Not overly complex - pretty much a single plot line that's not difficult to follow
* Interesting enough to continuously keep me engaged through four books plus a short story.

The not-so-good:

* Friggin' typos, which drives me crazy
* Whereas most main characters are really well developed, it seems like the author kinda forgot to develop one of them
* One of the minor characters who is featured for about half a book speaks way too much like Jar Jar Binks for my comfort
* Magic system is a bit softer than I'd prefer, but that's a personal preference

These books don't measure up to Sanderson/Rothfuss/Hobb, but I'm still really impressed with the quality of the stories from an author I'd never heard of before.

Check them out!  You can get book #0.5, a short story, for free on the author's web site ([https://www.justinfike.com/shadows-of-the-past-download](https://www.justinfike.com/shadows-of-the-past-download)), and it's a great sample of his writing style and the world he's created.

And no, I'm not Justin Fike using a fake account, and yes, I paid money for each of the books, etc.  You have my solemn oath as a stranger on the internet.

Enjoy!"
772,Fantasy,I’m halfway through the crimson queen by Alec Hutson. Can anyone convince me to finish?,"The books so far is purely cliche tropes, fairly shallow characters, and nothing original or exciting, as far as I can tell. I’m so sick of the young boy leaves his family on a coming of age magical journey to be the chosen one, and I couldn’t care less. The magic also seems soft, but in a way that doesn’t inspire wonder in me (and I don’t love soft magic anyway). Does it ditch the tropes? Does the magic become interesting? Is the plot ever good?"
773,Fantasy,"I'm Mike Brooks, author of new epic fantasy novel THE BLACK COAST (and other things too). ASK ME ANYTHING!"," For me, doing an AMA on Reddit was the most important day of my life. For you, it was Tuesday.

(Sorry, I watched \*Street Fighter\* again recently)

Anyway, hi. I’m Mike Brooks, aka “that SFF author with the mohawk”. I’ve written grimy space-opera trilogy \*The Keiko Series\* and various works for Games Workshop’s Black Library, including Warhammer 40,000 Ork novel \*Brutal Kunnin\*, and most recently, the Primarchs novel \*Alpharius: Head of the Hydra\*. However, I’m here today in relation to my new epic fantasy series \*The God-King Chronicles\*: \*The Black Coast\* came out in the UK last month, and comes out in the US today - thanks to Hanna from Rebellion Publishing for sorting this out for me with Reddit!

\*The Black Coast\* is the first volume in the trilogy (all three are contracted for publication, and I’ve just finished writing the third, so don’t worry about the series not getting finished: it is), and is a novel primarily about two cultures who have fought in the past now finding themselves in a situation where they need to learn to live with each other and work together in order to survive. It’s quite a hopeful book in many ways, although things don’t go well for everyone, by any means. I’ve tried to use language in interesting ways to denote cultural differences, such as one culture lacking any first-person pronouns, since their sense of self is so closely tied to their position within society, and another one having six forms of gender address which are signified by diacritics.

776,Fantasy,"Dungeon born, by Dakota krout. One of the most irritating human main character.","The book is fantastic, the explanations are freaking brilliant, and thr journey is just epic.
But for the love of God, that main character, oh my god, I have never read a book with a more hypocritical main character yet, 0 wit, 0 self awareness, and the most sinful of em all, self righteousness.
Imagine going into a dungeon for your greed and own self benefit, , and the blaming the dungeon for no reason at all, cause u suck, and that after the fact, that u became a noble from a fking sheep herder due to the dungeon, and the spouting shit like hard work.
Honestly the book is amazing, but the main character just makes it a 1.5/5.

If only the main character was a scheming piece of shit, that would have been still a 4/5, but the poor attitude of this guy.

If I could sum him up, he is the kind of guy, who would spat in his parents face, even if they sacrificed their lives for his well being, and for no reason other than them not able to provide him with comfort.
Honestly, who charges at an enemy and the shouts curses at em for fighting back, and lacking so much self awareness that it's just astonishing.
The rest of the supporting cast are meh, at least thry know that thr mc is a dimwit and exploits him."

779,Fantasy,Para's Proper Reviews: Skyward Inn by Aliya Whiteley,"*ARC received from the publisher (Solaris) in exchange for an honest review.* 

I’m always on the lookout for more SFF slice of life. Especially weird literary SFF slice of life. So when Fabienne brought this book to my attention, I knew I’d have to read it. And it turned out to be one of the most unique things I’ve found in a while – at the same time somehow a seamless blend of super chill sci-fi slice of life (slight Becky Chambers vibes anyone?) and something altogether more unsettling.  
  
&gt; *We burn history down, over and over, as an act of remembrance. When there are no answers, there is recollection, and repetition.* 

Jem and Isley – a human and a Qitan alien – manage the titular Skyward Inn. It’s a place where people from a small village in the Protectorate, a community of humans that rejects technological progress, can share a drink and exchange stories of the past. It all starts as a very quiet slice of life story, just Jem’s POV, in first person, alternating with that of her estranged teenage son, in third person, following their daily lives, but it slowly and seamlessly blends in an element of strangeness bordering on horror.

There is a very literary feel to it and the prose is absolutely stunning. Even though it’s a very short novel, it felt exactly as long as it needs to be. I loved how natural and gradual the change in tone felt – never jarring, and even though I’m a wimp who normally avoids horror like the plague and is *especially* sensitive to body horror, I wasn’t ever terrified or disgusted enough to stop reading. Creeped out, sure, but not in a way that’d be a dealbreaker.

In addition to that, it also touches upon complex family relationships, space colonization and how it affects communities, and personal autonomy. The tagline, “this is a place where we can be alone, together” is very on point. Only now I realise it hits another of my favourite tropes, books that take place *after* a big conflict is done and deal with its aftermath. It’s not a central plot since the focus is firmly on the characters, but it’s there.

Most highly recommended.

**Enjoyment:** 4.5/5

782,Fantasy,Bad Witch Burning: an upcoming dark contemporary YA fantasy: a review,"[Bad Witch Burning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50028605-bad-witch-burning) is a contemporary YA fantasy by Jessica Lewis that is slated to be released in August by [Delacorte](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50028605-bad-witch-burning). 

I received this as an ARC and have tried to make sure my review is as unbiased as possible. That said, I absolutely love this book. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Trigger Warnings:** animal death, physical and emotional abuse of a minor, gaslighting, murder/manslaughter with some gore. It’s not super graphic, but it does happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

This book is light on the world building and heavy on the characters, immersion, and emotional response. It hit me hard from the author’s note/dedication and continued until the end of the book (and beyond, really, because the book hangover for this was real!) It’s unapologetically #ownvoices and #BlackGirlMagic, and shines a harsh light on real world issues faced by teens every day, with a new spin on zombies/undead/necromancy and ghosts.

I never thought of myself as someone who enjoyed contemporary fantasy because I love lots of worldbuilding, but I’ve read a string of contemporary fantasies lately that are changing my mind and this one is no exception. It doesn’t suffer at all from the real world setting, and in fact, that aids the story because the focus is on the characters, who feel multi-dimensional and fully realized. 

The magic is not a hard magic system, but it isn’t prone to info-dumps either. While the main character, Katrell, already has her powers at the beginning, they’re easily explained as we see them in action, and the exposition is delivered in brief snippets that are strong with voice, so it didn’t feel like exposition. And then when her magic suddenly does change, the nature of those changes are discovered by the reader and Katrell hadn’t in hand.

The plot is easy to follow and straight-forward, delivered in a single point of view, first person (Katrell) present tense. Normally I don’t love first person, but it really worked here to pull me in. The storytelling is straight-forward without tons of descriptive language. There are descriptions, but they aren’t poetic. They’re mostly focused on Katrell’s emotional response to the events and the motivations for her choices, which make this a fast-paced, tightly woven story without fluff but which packs a lot of emotional punch.

Quick bit about the plot: Katrell is our protagonist, a 16 year old who’s balancing so much trouble and responsibility that high school seems like the least of her concerns. She is far more worried about having a roof over her head and something to eat, even if it’s just a couple of Pop-Tarts or some crackers and peanut butter (hidden in her room) for a meal. She juggles (badly) school and two part-time jobs, taking as many hours as she can get because her mom is “in between jobs” (and has been for months), and her mom’s deadbeat boyfriend-of-the-month comes over, eats all their food (which is why she hides food), and never helps with any bills. They’d have been homeless by now if it weren’t for her side-scheme. Katrell can talk to the dead, and people are willing to pay money for conversations with their dearly departed loved ones. 

But then a ghost tells Katrell to stop talking to the dead or she’ll “burn everything down”. Katrell tries, but then her hours get cut and rent is due. As if that wasn’t bad enough, her mom’s boyfriend threatens her and hits her, and her mom won’t defend her, just telling her to respect him so he won’t get angry and hit her more. Katrell has no one to turn to. Her mastiff is her loyal companion, but he wouldn’t hurt a flea, and her mom tells her it’s her fault, but also promises that it’s “you and me, forever” and “things will get better soon”. Things spiral from there.

I’m not going to go more into the plot because I don’t want to spoil anything. From here on I’m going to talk in vague terms. 

But the characters are where this book really shines. Let me tell you about the characters. 

Katrell’s voice is so strong and she’s easy to root for even when she makes awful decisions. Her desperation comes through, and her relationship with her toxic mother is the first time I felt really seen, from how she lies to herself to allow herself to keep holding on, downplaying her mother’s abuse and focusing only on the rare good times, believing her mom despite her lies. She’s desperate to prove she’s the good daughter, desperate to keep them financially afloat, and killing herself with too much responsibility and nowhere to turn. 

But it’s not just Katrell. Every character’s motivations made sense, and each had their own goals and struggles. 

Will is her best friend, and Will’s tragic experiences in the foster system reinforce Katrell’s determination to stick with her mom. Will’s facing her own struggles too, slowly learning to trust her newly adoptive parents, even with such things as being able to look them in the eye or speak to them. She’s got her own goals too, pursuing an art competition even in the face of bullying (mostly due to Katrell refusing to let her give up). And nothing is wasted in this book as even Will’s struggles with learning to drive play a role in impacting the plot. Will is the light shining for Katrell on how things *can* be. 

Katrell and Will’s friendship is awesome. Even when they fight, even when Katrell goes and does the very thing Will tells her not to do, they clearly care about each other. Katrell pushes Will to keep improving, to not let fear stop her, but also she’s patient with her, tries to protect her, and tries to think of Will’s wishes and safety—at least, until she's drowning under her mountain of mess (that she built herself) and sets her world on fire. And Will is fiercely loyal to Katrell, including delivering hard words to Katrell when she needs them. 

Mike the guidance counselor is amazing. He doesn’t know exactly what’s going on with Katrell because she can’t bring herself to trust him, but he’s pretty sure her home life isn’t good (though he has no idea how bad it is) and he tries to help. He role-models healthy boundaries for Katrell and good goal-setting, which she then uses with Will to encourage her. Mike and Katrell’s scenes are short but sweet and full of impact. 

I loved how even minor characters impact the plot, whether they’re setting fires and contributing to Katrell’s burning her life away, or whether they’re there helping to slosh water on the flames. &gt;!If it was just Will, things would’ve ended differently (even though Will is amazing), because the lifeline wouldn't hold up to the fire. It's too easy for something to go wrong, or to rationalize that you're really still all alone. But four lifelines, all from different people who are showing her what love really means, that's why she can fight back to the surface.!&lt;

This book was incredibly emotionally engaging for me and deeply immersive. It’s possible that it’d be less emotionally intense if I didn’t see my own childhood in Katrell’s relationship with her mom. I don’t normally cry with books but I did with this one, and I cried after too. I struggled to put the book down to do anything else. The chapters are short and snappy, and there’s no filler. I think every plot point that came up was used, as I mentioned above with Will and Mike. The cover is probably the thing I like least about this book. It’s good, but it’s just not my favorite. But I did come away from the book with further musings on the impact poverty can have on kids especially, as these concerns drive so much of the book and ring with truth. 

&amp;#x200B;

This book is heavy but it's a good kind of heavy. The troubles Katrell's really dealing with are troubles people deal with every day. The Revenants are just the figurative piece. And Katrell is so determined and Will is phenomenal and their interactions are so wholesome, it keeps it from being too heavy in my opinion.

783,Fantasy,Review: A Country of Ghosts by Margaret Killjoy,"&gt;Freedom, I think, isn’t enough. You need freedom and responsibility together. As Sorros would say, freedom is a relationship between people, not an absolute and static state for an individual.

Anarchism is widely considered too utopian to ever work in reality. Fantasy literature, then, is the perfect place to explore the possibility. Science-fiction tends to use such concepts more often but the work I’m reviewing, Margaret Killjoy’s **A Country of Ghosts**, is a notable fantasy example.

Written in the tradition of works like **The Dispossessed** by Ursula K. Le Guin, Killjoy’s novel is partially a story and partially a look at an anarchist utopia. Killjoy is herself an anarchist and the work is full of concepts from anarchist and other leftist theory: mutual aid, solidarity, decentralization, and so on. I will admit to having not read much more than a few articles and Wikipedia pages on these sorts of concepts at the time of writing this review but the book explains it well enough if, like me, you aren't well read in anarchist theory. 

To quote the description of the book on Amazon: “Dimos Horacki is a Borolian journalist and a cynical patriot, his muckraking days behind him. But when his newspaper ships him to the front, he’s embedded in the Imperial Army and the reality of colonial expansion is laid bare before him.

His adventures take him from villages and homesteads to the great refugee city of Hronople, built of glass, steel, and stone, all the while a war rages around him. The empire fights for coal and iron, but the anarchists of Hron fight for their way of life.”

Dimos is our protagonist and narrator. (Minor detail but he’s also into other men.) The narrative voice is matter of fact, which fits his occupation as a journalist reporting on another culture; it makes for average prose. As can be surmised from the synopsis, the story features him “going native” among the people of Hron. The book is short and focuses just as equally on the fighting between the Empire and Hron’s militia as the worldbuilding of the society. Killjoy borders on anarchist propaganda but the story itself was at least still somewhat interesting **for me personally** due to some of the characters like Nola, Sorros (my personal favorite in the book), Grem, and Jackal. I would have liked to have gotten a longer work for a deeper examination of the characters.

The worldbuilding is the main attraction here. The setting seems inspired by the nineteenth century, which feels appropriate since the community featured recalls the utopian communities of the era. We see different parts of the country, learn about their culture, and we even get to see a city of people who left Hron after choosing to not honor the Hron Accord. As world building it was decent to me, especially the towns and city in the “country of ghosts,” though I wish she had made up another term rather than having the characters self-identify as anarchists. 

As a book, **A Country of Ghosts** isn’t particularly noteworthy. It can get kind of preachy in its anarchism due to the utopian themes at times, some of the characters could have used a bit more fleshing out, and the ending feels too abrupt. If looking for fantasy from a leftist or anarchist viewpoint specifically, I would instead recommend Killjoy’s Tor.com novella, **The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion**, which, despite being shorter, has better character work and storytelling. It’s probably unfair to compare this work to Le Guin’s **The Dispossessed** but if there’s one way I wish this work would have resembled the Le Guin work, it would have been in its subtlety. Yet even despite how many issues I have with the book, I still enjoyed reading it."
784,Fantasy,Michelle West (Essalieyan Universe) Question,"So I've only just discovered West's work recently, but I'm really, *really* enjoying it. 

I've read House War Books 1-3 (following a reading order I found online)...it's at this point that the reading order recommends reading The Sacred Hunt Duology (Hunter's Oath, Hunter's Death) and I know that the second book, Hunter's Death, at least covers a lot of the same story as the 3rd House War book (House Name)...and I'm wondering how much of it. Like am I going to read Hunter's Death and feel bored by the exploration of the same story points from a different angle? I don't really want to skip Sacred Hunt (I'm a completionist), but I would be curious if it makes more sense to just read it and move forward, or if it makes more sense to move directly onto Sun Sword and the remaining House War books and then just circle back to Sacred Hunt as a kind of outlier?

Any help would be appreciated.

Also, I don't hear enough people talk about this series, but it's really impressive so far."

Is it going to be back on Rand's pov on book 4? I already started on the first chapter and there are multiple NEW povs again. I'm worried this is going to be another new set of characters pov and for that I've had enough.

792,Fantasy,Servant of the Empire - A good follow up to a great book that falls short of being great,"I loved Daughter of the Empire and was quick to jump into Servant.

It's a good book, but it is frustrating at times.  It's a longer book, and it feels it.  Most of the length seems to be from enemy POV, which rarely adds anything.  There is no nuance to Mara's enemies and even worse they tell us their traps for Mara, so when we get to Mara's chapters, there is no mystery, we know exactly what is going on.

Mara still makes a few mistakes which cost her, but she also made some rookie mistakes, stuff where it should be clear that something is amiss.  The biggest one for me was &gt;!against the desert tribes, they kept commenting that this made no sense, the Minwanabi had already made attempts on her and her goods, how did they not suspect anything?!&lt; 

My other big complaint is why did Mara &gt;!never try to assassinate her enemies?  They set trap after trap, sent assassins and Mara doesnt try once other than through politicing.!&lt;

&gt;!I know at one point Arakasi says he hand doesnt reach that far, but this was late in the book, and I dont believe it.  It takes just one servant with poison willing to go on a suicide mission for honor.  Im sure one of his spies would have been willing.  Even if he couldnt pull that off, her not at least asking about it earlier is baffling.  While I know it isn't Mara's nature to just kill for gain, this would be protecting her self, not senseless murder for gain!&lt;

Despite my few issues with this book, it still is really good and a worthy follow up to a great book.  I look forward to finishing the trilogy."
793,Fantasy,Review: Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter (Spoiler Free),"Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter

It feels so good when you go into a book with such high expectations, and somehow, the author goes above and beyond what you were expecting. 

I'll do my best to keep this review very vague to avoid any form of spoilers cause I want the book to be a fresh and clean experience for new readers

The world building for the book was a factor I was most interested in, especially since I'd never read an African inspired fantasy world before this. And honestly I was really happy with how Evan Winter managed to portray and setup everything, the details to specific forts and locations was magnificent, but at the same time Evan Winter managed to just keep it as a background theme and never really started shoving the world into your face. This might not be as related, but I liked the names of nearly every character simply because it never felt generic or unnecessarily complex, instead, it fitted together extremely well with the characters.
The lore and history of the entire world was nice to know too, but I felt like some parts were exposition dumps, though much more interesting than they could've been.

Speaking of characters, this book certainly hammered down the ideals and motivations of individual characters, no one ever felt unrealistically stagnant and instead we managed to see evolutions of different sorts. At few intervals in the book, we get different povs for specific scenes and seeing all those thought processes from the other person really gives everything a nice depth.

And as for that famous pacing, fans are right when they say Evan Winter writes really fast paced novels. There were several times I felt like a bit more time could be spent on a specific scene, but it went by so fast you're just left hungry for more. While it did get irritating at times, I really appreaciated it since other authors might have bloated their page count by another 150 pages rather than trimming down the days of the book.

Initially when I tried to start the book, I felt the prose was funky and it was hard for me to adapt to it which was why I dropped it after 20 pages. But when I gave the book a second try a week later, I got used to the writing style very quickly and the simplistic prose made much more sense somehow. Speaking of prose, the way Winter wrote his battles and fight sequences was truly an impressive feat. Alot of the books I've read tend to get very vague on the side of combat and you usually don't get that epic sensation. In this book however, every move and counter is described with detail and it helps create this move looking scene in your own mind,  something which really helps increase the stakes and epicness of every fight. The gore was pretty intense too, I'd almost say this book is grimdark but it has a much more hopeful theme than that, so I guess it's just the violence which gets intense. For a guy like me, explicitly written scenes with brutalities and slaughterings made the book more fun to read

Another slight tangent here but I gotta give credit to the author for finding such a talented artist to draw the cover. The art is already magnificent as is, but when you look closer and managed to spot out some characters, it looks all the more cooler. The title is pretty friggin dope too, I found out kinda weird at first but when you finish the book you manage to see the deep meaning behind it.

Romance was really really really good, and again, the author broke so many tropes here it was unbelievable. The way characters were portrayed in the relationship made you relish it every time Winter mentioned a relationship

And as you might expect, the plot itself is truly a masterpiece when you manage to connect all those little hints and clues at the end of the book. The plot just twists and turns throughout the book and defies every prediction. Everytime I thought Winter was gonna follow a trope, he somehow read my mind and just broke free of that trope altogether. And honestly, it's just nice to read a book where the protagonist doesn't hold back due to some good guy thoughts of forgiveness. The ending kinda surprised me, but again it was written so well you're literally gonna be shaking with anticipation and excitement the moment you finish it.

Magic system was as unique as everything else, and did it's job by captivating me everytime it was mentioned or out into use. The fact that there's stakes to even using it gives a more realistic side to it, and doesn't feel immensely overpowered or unfair since everything is somewhat balanced.

The only slight criticism I had was the naming for specific ranks, like it was quite hard to remember and differentiate it in the beginning but fortunately there was a glossary near the end oft he book which helped a tonne.

All in all, the book was an amazing debut for Evan Winter, and I give it a solid 10/10 for not letting me down in anything. I'm excited to read the nest book, and for anyone interested, I'd highly recommend you give the book a go if you want a tamer version of grimdark or just a great book in general"
794,Fantasy,Review: The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie,"The Blade Itself is one of my first few grimdark novels, after A Game of Thrones, and honestly it already stands high above the crowd and exceeded many expectations

Before anything, I want to get into the biggest criticism I have for this book; the lack of plot. People don't joke when they say this book is a bit lacking on one of those heavy and important plot lines, and even though I had expected something similar when I went into the book, it was still quite surprising how much it lacked in terms of a general plot. We basically just follow these individual challenges of 3 characters, though we get some really fun POV's sometimes in the book. But don't get me wrong, this book still did have a fairly decent amount of plot, and I'd say it really helped build up the entire world and it's conflicts, but most of the important plot threads only end up coming about halfway through the book, and most of them are left incomplete for the next book. But honestly the depth of character and their motivations more than compensated for the lack of plot, they're what actually kept me hooked onto the book for so long. Like Glokta's depth in terms of character and background was just so well written, and is easily what made him my favourite character.

Then we have the prose; I'd say Abercrombie's prose is more similar to Brandon Sanderson's in terms of its simplicity, but at the same time the way everything is portrayed or described in Blade Itself is incredibly more gritty and somewhat dark, and Abercrombie does it in a way where he doesn't end up tossing overly complex words at your face. The combat sequences were written really well using this same prose, and it gave you this really nice level of immersiveness in the combat scene, though tbh I still think Evan Winter wrote combat best. But in the overall grand scheme of warfare, Abercrombie certainly managed to deliver that epicness of warfare. 
I'm not sure if it was just me, but i felt that the prose varied in certain areas depending on characters, like I think this was done intentionally to better show the mindset of the characters

I thoroughly enjoyed the worldbuilding though, and I feel like Abercrombie slightly modified his prose for those scenes specifically to help deliver it in the best way possible. There were times where an extremely beautiful portrait would be painted through text, but at others it seemed Abercrombie was being as brutal and harsh about the world as possible.

 Speaking of brutal, the gore in this book is taken to the next level and that really really made it more fun to read. Like Abercrombie is another one of those few authors who never backs down from describing something violent in detail, and that also helped create a dark overall tone. There were often times where characters had to make hard choices, these choices usually had a right or wrong element to them, but due to the need for survival, our characters often surprise us with decisions they make. That was really showed the moral greyness of everyone, no person was simply innocent through and through

While this may sound incredibly annoying to some, I found this book very realistic in some aspects such as the combat or the view on warfare as a whole. And those idealogies were integrating really well with character personalities.

I enjoyed the politics a tonne too, and this is where alot of Glokta's internal dialogue came handy. No political figure ever seemed too easy to predict, instead, we just start to doubt them more and more as we try to find their main goal

I had a minor issue with the names, since I forgot dozens of names halfway through the book and failed to recognise some characters. But as I said, this is a subjective thing and it's likely just that my memory is horrible

Pacing was somewhat slow, though it picks up really well near the end of the book. And as I said, you're usually too immersed in the worldbuilding to give a damn about the pacing.

Romance was quite good as well, though I do admit it got annoying after a bit when all I wanted was to read another Glokta chapter lol

Dialogue was fantastic imo, and every joke made landed really well and had me giggling for ages whenever I recalled it.

Magic system was decent, though we don't really go too much into it. But that was just as well since there were better things to focus on, and it's nice having magic being one of those mysterious/unknown things.

All in all, I think I can give the book a solid 8/10, and in terms of setup this book does extremely well. I'm really hyped to get started on the next book, cause I know that all the setup is finally gonna pay off now. I apologise if my review is poorly structured, it's been awhile since I wrote one of these. I was intentionally vague on the details cause I want this book to be a fresh experience for any new readers."

800,Fantasy,Classics? April Book Poll,"The theme for April is the 1930s.

The nominees:

[The Hobbit](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/935eea29-cdc0-4487-b1f6-db74cfd62c22) by J.R.R Tolkien - published 1937
&gt;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

[At the Mountains of Madness](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cc4a1bd5-c363-48af-af54-98eda66035cf) by H.P Lovecraft - published 1931
&gt;The Barren, windswept interior of the Antarctic plateau was lifeless--or so the expedition from Miskatonic University thought. Then they found the strange fossils of unheard-of creatures...and the carved stones tens of millions of years old...and, finally, the mind-blasting terror of the City of the Old Ones.

[Mary Poppins](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/6f43b451-5133-404a-91d7-d0ced50c3a0d) by P.L. Travers - published 1934
&gt;It all starts when Mary Poppins is blown by the east wind onto the doorstep of the Banks house. She becomes a most unusual nanny to Jane, Michael, and the twins. Who else but Mary Poppins can slide up banisters, pull an entire armchair out of an empty carpetbag, and make a dose of medicine taste like delicious lime-juice cordial? A day with Mary Poppins is a day of magic and make-believe come to life!

[Out of the Silent Planet](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/19071ec6-6ad1-45d2-921b-51df4fbde1a7) by C.S. Lewis - published 1938
&gt;In the first novel of C.S. Lewis's classic science fiction trilogy, Dr Ransom, a Cambridge academic, is abducted and taken on a spaceship to the red planet of Malacandra, which he knows as Mars. His captors are plotting to plunder the planet's treasures and plan to offer Ransom as a sacrifice to the creatures who live there. Ransom discovers he has come from the 'silent planet' – Earth – whose tragic story is known throughout the universe...

[Turnabout](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1184211e-201b-490c-a58a-fcd6421c18b8) by Thorne Smith - published 1931
&gt;Sally Willows envied her adman husband his glamorous work; Tim Willows felt Sally lived in ease and luxury while he was sweating to pay the bills. So an ill-tempered minor god, tired of their bickering, worked a modest miracle...
&gt;
&gt;...and Sally Willows, no occupying her husband's body, experienced the full horrors of the Nationwide Advertising Agency, while Tim, now outwardly Sally, dealt with the amourous advances of a local Lothario.

[The Circus of Dr. Lao](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d364b84f-b412-4e06-846f-bffaa9e5ae6b) by Charles G Finney - published 1935
&gt;Abalone, Arizona, is a sleepy southwestern town whose chief concerns are boredom and surviving the Great Depression. That is, until the circus of Dr. Lao arrives and immensely and irrevocably changes the lives of everyone drawn to its tents. Expecting a sideshow spectacle, the citizens of Abalone instead confront and learn profound lessons from the mythical made real--a chimera, a Medusa, a talking sphinx, a sea serpent, witches, the Hound of the Hedges, a werewolf, a mermaid, an ancient god, and the elusive, ever-changing Dr. Lao. The circus unfolds, spinning magical, dark strands that ensnare the town's populace: the sea serpent's tale shatters love's illusions; the fortune-teller's shocking pronouncements toll the tedium and secret dread of every person's life; sensual undercurrents pour forth for men and women alike; and the dead walk again.

[At Swim-Two Birds](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/124427b3-8405-4dd6-8531-459c1db27266) by Flann O'Brien - published 1939
&gt;A wildly comic send-up of Irish literature and culture, At Swim-Two-Birds is the story of a young, lazy, and frequently drunk Irish college student who lives with his curmudgeonly uncle in Dublin. When not in bed (where he seems to spend most of his time) or reading he is composing a mischief-filled novel about Dermot Trellis, a second-rate author whose characters ultimately rebel against him and seek vengeance. From drugging him as he sleeps to dropping the ceiling on his head, these figures of Irish myth make Trellis pay dearly for his bad writing.

801,Fantasy,The theory of Shapes," 

The Theory of Shapes is a short story about philosophy from the perspective of a Nazi German soldier. It quickly turns intriguingly philosophical. It is just a shame it took so long for his story to come out. 

This is the summary on apple books. His goal seems to give people a more fun conceptual understanding of our universe, it is like a bob ross mentality on life. I spent hours trying to put two of the same ends of a magnet together.  the whole story is only available on apple books. 

Juxtaposed on and amongst various crates, items, and comrades. I question my luck in even being in the back of this truck. I have on so many occasions been very close to death, and only because of some irrefutable way in which the events took place, I am here today, in this truck, listening to these men. I thought specifically about a bullet which had almost taken my life two months earlier, it was a rather heavy one, coming from far, and I’m sure had the wind been the slightest more to his liking, he may have been proud of himself that day. I do not want to assume other men, but this particle situation felt as if there was more intentional hate and hunting than usual. He knows nothing of me either, and if this where the case he more than likely assumes me to be an individual in which he hates, which given the circumstances, especially at that particular moment, where understandable. This kind of individual, the one who tried to take my life that day, reminds me of another soldier in my association named Wilhelm, and how he was really the individual in which the other hated, yet the two of them, to me, where probably very similar. I asked myself what is was that made these men this way? It looks arrogant to me sure, but I also understand that there is no choice, so it can’t really be just arrogance, possibly more simply a matter of where you are from? However, this certainly can not be case because I myself don’t feel the same as Wilhelm and we are from the same city, however I love my country and my countrymen. I have to question the state in which I find my existence. Wilhelm and I have been told that this is what’s best, and there is little that would change his mind. I understand why Hitler wants this war, for the reasons he says and for the obvious ones, and that may be beneficial to germans, however I can not convince myself that objectively it is what is right. I can’t be certain of anything and from any other perspective my blood boils with anger at the ideas of the what horrible things the state has done and could be doing. 

It always seems like such things couldn’t be happening, until after the fact when you realized you saw and heard everything you just weren’t paying attention. The truck was taking us to Paris and I had decided to instead consider the city in which I would be inhabiting. Paris’ inherit beauty upon arriving could still be imagined under the destruction, if one had a creative imagination. I felt nothing of beauty towards myself, the city was still somehow dignified and it made us look, or maybe only realized to myself and the French, very ugly and abusive. If you asked Wilhelm why he would want to do such a thing to such a beautiful city he would tell you, it may look bad now, but soon she will be better than she was before. I know Wilhelm is not a bad guy, and in some ways as I mentioned a good guy, but I have to also see how some American would see him as being a bad guy, and also the bad guy, and there is no amount of convincing to anyone at this point that I am any different than Wilhelm. He is going to be a father soon and in that I have the most confidence. The only way in which I can understand Wilhelm to be good or bad is from where ever it is I decide to place my perspective, and I ask myself if there is even a difference between good and bad and perspective. If plato says that virtue is about feelings and actions in which excess is in error and deficiency is blamed, whereas the intermediate condition is praised and is correct, which are both proper to virtue… then there is only one way to be correct, that is why error is easy and correctness is difficult, since it easy to miss the target and difficult to hit, “for we are noble in only one way, but bad in all sorts of ways.”

Is it then not up to us to trust that which governs us, on the inside and out, like Wilhelm, however, if any inner conflict arises in an individual, because of a fundamental issue with that individuals inner condition, an individual placed within a condition in which they do not agree or understand, would then this individual be less virtuous than Wilhelm? Who decides that his inner condition agrees with its outer one and therefore no conflict arises and he his then considered virtuous, more so than I, who does not act on his inner condition and forces his outer one to comply. At the same time, we doubt, to doubt is to exist, so to not doubt that which governs us is to be blind, I guess that’s what Wilhelm is, blind and virtuous, however he believes he has hit the target, I can see the possibility of the deception behind his perspective. 

One day in the spring, I took the whole day to get out of the city. I wanted to spend the whole day in my head . Early, I got on a BMW R75 and headed out the barracks downtown we had been stationed in. I wasn’t entirely sure which direction I was going. I pulled out my compass that was in my bag along with cider and other various things. I decided to go south and thought about how the compass was particularly useful at the moment due to that fact I had been in the city a short while and the sun hadn’t yet risen. My watch read just after three thirty, and I questioned whether this should ever prove useful outside my present war related conditions, which I was desperate to get out of. The perspectives of others would certainly see me as that which I am not, yet I am certainly not myself at the present moment. In the afternoon, I found an area that seemed little disturbed by anyone, and where the denser forest met the meadow, I placed myself, and sat for several hours. Watching, listening to the wind blow, everything moving, changing the forrest, it all appeared to be alive. As the sun set I was reminded once again there is a darks side to the earth at any given moment. The dirt road I had road in on was now occupied by a man with two horses. As the man approached the area between me and the setting sun, he ultimately became a silhouette of a hat and beard held high. 

“Would you like a better view, comrade ?”

I realized I may have looked rather pathetic, I got up and brushed myself off. 

“Sure, what do you have in mind ?” 

“I manage this property and the estate up on the hill.”

The man gestured to the other horse. 

“Hop on Betsy and I’ll take you up there.” 

Betsys big black eyes started at mine. Guy seemed more comfortable with me than I was with him, and I was the one on a German bike. I guess he’s just been rather informed on who is in charge. 

We passed through a large farm, farther down was an old, small church he informed me had been turned secular, along with the rest of the property, and used for storage, in particular books from public and private collections.  

“You are a Nazi too?”

“Not exactly.” 

“Why is it you are showing me this?”

“I understand how easy it is to find yourself…here.” 

We approached the front of the church. 

“My name is Wolfgang.” 

The man opened the lock, removed the chain from the two beaten doors, and dropped the heavy lock on the earth beneath us. 

The man smiled at me and he let out sarcastic, “Yaay”! And swung the doors open. 

“Tell me, Wolfgang, have you ever thought about what it is you know for certain ?” 

“You could say that..” 

“Well, there is a lot you can learn in these books, they may appear worthless to you at the moment, but value is in the beholder, and they can determine this value however they wish. In some cases it serves very useful.” 

He grabbed a book out of a small dusty pile on the table and tossed it in my direction causing a small explosion of dusty particles to be blown onto me. I sat down and spun the book towards me. 

“Understanding something as certain is a difficult thing, for Descartes the only things in which he can he can be truly certain is that he is is doubting, therefore he is existing. He found faith that because he was doubting the existence of god and he could never be certain if god is real or not, it meant to him there was most likely a god. Outside of this the only thing that Descartes allows himself to have any certainty in is math.”

I read in mediation I, “We are bound at the same time to confess that there are at least some other objects yet more simple and more universal, which are real and true; and of these just in the same way as with certain real colours, all these images of things which dwell in our thoughts, whether true and real or false and fantastic, are formed. To such a class of things pertains corporeal nature in general, and its extension, the figure of extended things, their quantity or magnitude and number, as also the place in which they are, the time which measures their duration, and so on. That is possibly why our reasoning is not unjust when we conclude from this that Physics, Astronomy, Medicine and all other sciences which have as their end the consideration of composite things, are very dubious and uncertain; but that Arithmetic, Geometry and other sciences of that kind which only treat of things that are very simple and very general, without taking great trouble to ascertain whether they are actually existent or not, contain some measure of certainty and an element of the indubitable. For whether I am awake or asleep, two and three together always form five, and the square can never have more than four sides, and it does not seem possible that truths so clear and apparent can be suspected of any falsity \[or uncertainty\].” 

“Do you know what the Golden Ratio is ?” 

“Something in architecture?”

“Yeah, well, its a phenomena of geometry and math and because of this it can be found throughout nature, our calendar, and even used in art and architecture for its aesthetic quality. If you image four different sized cubes raging in size, these cubes are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.

There is a long debate about geometry and where it comes from. It basically comes down to a Descartes perspective, that would say that because geometry is fundamental in nature and because we are also made from nature, geometry is something that we are born with, like a human primal instinct, 1 is 1, 2 is 2. There is also the perspective of someone like manual Kahn who would say that anything outside the mind, anything we think we understand is a creation of the mind, and therefore nature would be represented within the mind, but man would be ultimately the one shaping everything. This creates two sides, either man shapes nature, or nature shapes man.”

The man walked over to the shelves and grabbed a small thin frame out from within it.

“I am sure what you have seen recently has you believing man shapes everything, even other men…I can try and help you find another perspective, if that’s what you are looking for.” 

The man slid the rectangle in front of me.

“What is this ?” 

He motioned towards the painting. 

“In the middle of the painting there is a shadow of a large hill, imagine yourself on that hill like Isaac Newton, sitting under an apple tree. The apple in the tree above you is being held from a thin vine that is in tension. Where is it you think this tension comes from? 

The man grabbed a pen and book from the table and wrote down. 

E=mc\^2 

“Einsteins, theory of relativity, here he is saying energy is equal to the mass times the gravitational constant squared, or an acceleration lets say, its analogous to Isaac newtons second law, force is equal to the mass times its acceleration.” 

The man rights down. F=ma 

“I know, I learned this in school.” 

“I know, but there is still the question, what is acceleration, it’s the same thing as gravity, and energy so what is it?” 

“Energy exist in four forms, heat, light, kinetic and electromagnetic. In order to have energy, you have to have motion, in order to have motion you have to have a force. There are four forces that are responsible for all energy. The strong force, the electromagnetic force, the weak force, and gravity. These forces create energy. The strong force and the weak force are subatomic forces. In the subatomic world there is quark, which becomes everyday matter, and lepton, which is a family of force carrying particles. In this family there is gluon, the force carrying particle of quarks, binding them together in a cloud, electrons, the force craving particle of protons and neutrons, and photons, created from electrons and the force carrying particle of light. This creates a family that has within in it, gluon, electrons, and photons, which comes from electrons, so simply all Lepton. 

There is no connection between the subatomic rules of quantum chromo dynamics and the general theory of relativity, without the the cosmological constant, a single number. Physicist have been able to estimate the quantity of dark energy by looking at the force needed to produce the acceleration, the result is a very small amount of energy for every cubic meter of vacuum, however considering the cosmos is mostly empty space, dark energy dominates the universe. The energy from empty space comes from the virtual particles that dwell there, however when the equations of quantum theory are used to calculate the amount of energy they get an answer that is about 120 orders too large. 

If this bridge were to be built we would be looking at two things, lepton and matter. A single energy. The electromagnetic force, which is also an energy, light, heat, and the subatomic forces, leaves only gravity and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is possessed due to an objects motion. Kinetic energy is the result of this energy working through matter, and gravitational energy is as well. Consider lepton energy a single energy family. 

If this energy substance, makes up spacetime, and all of nature, and nature, like virtue, is better and more exact than any craft, and indistinguishable from geometry, could we then say that it is possible that the golden ratio is the acceleration of the universe? How fast the universe is traveling is recorded with a lot uncertainty, however, apparently, using natural units, it is somewhere around 1 Planck, so we are assuming within the margin of error that the cosmological constant is 0.6180.. repeating infinitely, this is the golden ratio conjugate, 0.61803…:1=1:1.61803…(the golden number) x\^2-x-1, has two roots the other being this conjugate, so like energy there is a positive and a negative.” 

I sat back and crossed my arms, realizing defensively, he had my full attention.

“Tell me more about this golden ratio, how can some thing that is accelerating be constant?” 

“Perspective… well it was found in cave drawings here in France dating back to 40,000 years ago. It as an aesthetic quality is one of the few things we humans can agree on. Mozart used it, if you want to hear what the universe sounds like listen to Fantasia. It has nothing to do with material, but only the way in which material is arranged.

If this is the case, and energy is an electromagnetic family, that has proven to be effected by or interact with itself, such as light and gravity, would it be more than likely that we can find a similar case on earth where these two energies interact or are effected by the other. Consider your compass, and the electromagnetic field surrounding the earth. The metal inside the earths core is interacting with this energy, creating a magnetic field that extends around the planet, this energy causes the convections in the earths core, resulting in the axis of the earth. The poles of the earth attract solar flares that create the Aurora borealis, dragging these particles in like gravity, this would then imply that the force of this energy would be significantly stronger at the poles. Gravity on the poles is 0.5 % higher than the equator, it’s thought that this is because of the centrifugal force from the bulge of the earth at the equator, however it could just as easily be explained the other way, the bulge of the earth being the result of the increased force from the poles, the same philosophy applies when implying that the axis causes the electric currents to form a magnetic field, and not the the electric current causing the axis. 

We have the apple, the apple falls and an energy is created. If energy is created by these forces and one of these forces is created by matter, while the others exist beautifully together, how could we say that the whole of energy is split due to our misconception of how energy works.. could it really be that the energy that is holding the vine in tension is caused by matter? The second law of thermo dynamics says that all natural process are irreversible and things are always moving forward. If you consider all energy, a result of these forces, and these forces a result of energy, they are all essentially descriptions of the same thing, energy. We have in the middle of this equation, ourselves(matter), and energy on both sides, are we not told then that matter is in some way responsible for energy? If the universe is accelerating, not decelerating, how could this be the case?”  

“The man versus nature debate is still there isn’t it ?” 

“Most definitely, we have this lepton energy we can sense, the interaction between this electromagnetic substance, which has fields and waves, with itself, and our own visible matter. Do particles allow for the energy to take place, or does the energy allow for the particles to take place? The current standard model suggest that after the big bang, matter came into contact with a lepton cloud, or Higgs field, which gave the particles their mass. Which is contradictory to the subatomic theory that suggest that lepton will spontaneously create missing quarks, and a uniform condition of the universe, placing heat literally outside the physical possibilities of big bang, something like our universe is this old, suggesting it would be this big, however its bigger, and nothing can travel faster than light, so why is there heat at the outer edges of our universe, which to us this energy would have to be there wouldn’t it”  

“Why do they still suggest it ?” 

“Probably found something that has them in a positive feed back loop of self-satisfaction like everything else, either way, the debate becomes does this energy substance shape matter or does matter shape this energy substance. Or shapes are first formed in nature, and then in us, or shapes are a creation of our mind.”

“Electrons technically have mass don’t they?” 

“They do.” 

“Is this why you are calling it a substance? …Could it explain the missing mass in the universe ?” 

“Imagine, Wolfgang, they have built you a craft that floats above and around the earth in space and you have arrived on this craft from another smaller craft and you go to urinate in your larger craft. After being released in to the near vacuum of space, the urine is boiled from the pressure resulting in a snowflake. Each one different than the next, an infinite number of ways that the molecules could crystalize, the ratio of each branch in the Golden ratio to the other. ” 

I looked down at my compass. 

“How can we know if we are or aren’t measuring the same thing?” 

“I have no idea Wolfgang, let’s go see your brothers on Ellesmere island…we recently measured gravitational waves from a black hole, which would make sense its energy, either way we know it’s there.” 

“Wouldn’t we be able to hear this energy?” 

“You can hear the sun, it sounds calming, while I Image a black hole sounds more like a lions roar.” 

“Haha, you think space is alive don’t you.” 

“Sure, it made us didn’t it.” 

“Good luck convincing any else of that.” 

“What do you think?” 

“Well it makes sense, the gravitational waves at least, I can imagine it analogous to waves in water, this energy working through an invisible medium, that may also have mass, like water.”

""You can look at history, which is information, and art, as information, from the perspective of the artist, or the individual in history, and you may be able to consider situations that would give you information on how a certain individual understands themselves. Everyone dies, therefore everyone suffers, therefore everyone asks themselves, who is it that is responsible? This is the question that humans ask themselves, certain individuals can show remarkable perspectives, they do so presumable for the best interest of others, and is it not true that those who have suffered in some cases the most, do the most to make others content, by showing a happier perspective. 

This painting is one of those times, Wolfgang.” 

I starred at the painting.

“This painting is directly influenced by Einsteins theory of relativity, look at the hands on a clock, you can imagine them moving around the clock still, however if you were to take that clock out of your mind and place it in the real world, and then tried to move the hands, the whole mechanism would break itself apart. As Einstein had proved, a clock can’t tell time. If you notice these clocks, melting over these objects, holding them down, the natural, the unnatural, the surreal. The surreal is the connection between the unnatural and natural, the mind, weighed down under the pressure of these oppressive ideas, time and gravity, do you understand how they are the same, nothing, and also the same misconception? Time is only our persistence of memory, both are a perspective that only exist in the mind. Our imagination Wolfgang, has the ability to bring this entire place to life if we want it too, it has to first be free too.

You can imagine this invisible substance, wrapping our blue planet, suspended in the solar system by the sun, and the entire universe held together by this mysterious invisible substance. Einstein recently said the happiest thought he ever had… He imagined gravity, not as gravity, but a geometric property of spacetime.”  

“Yeah, and what is to you ?” 

The man pulled out what appeared to be a large gold coin from his pocket and placed it on the table. 

“Oh, shit…” 

“It’s not what you think, it has been used in christianity and freemasonry as well.

The man picked it up and rotated the pentagram in his fingers.

The ratio of a diagonal to a side is in the golden ratio, while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio, to me energy may be like this pentagram, two sides of the same piece of paper, but who am I? … If Einstein wants gravity to be a geometric property of spacetime, then as far as I am concerned that’s what it is.” 

“That is a pretty happy thought.”"

I don’t have much to say about myself, so instead here’s a rundown of my work!  All my stories are set in the same, sprawling universe, so I’m gonna explain the basic chronology below.

In the near Future, the Earth falls into a resource crisis only partially resolved by the discovery of cold fusion energy.  Omar Rashid goes on a cross-country adventure through the Middle East and India aboard a 12,000,000 lb tank (In the Shadow of the Pylon), while on the moon, Mohandas and some fellow lunar engineers deal with rebels, traitors, and something not quite human (Static Beneath the Stars).

A century later, aliens have invaded Earth through tears in space, altering humanity.  In Australia, the ‘evil clone’ of a superhero combats aliens, crime bosses, and her own limited sense of worth (Not-so-Evil Origins).  Meanwhile, a boy faces down a crumbling social order that has kept his people suppressed for years by making them physically incapable of seeing their oppressors (City of Gates), and a girl journeys cross-country through Iran with a talking pheasant (Flight of the Pheasant King).

The aliens’ touch continues to corrupt the Earth, and millenia later, Europe has been taken over by fire-wielding birds who fight with sentient swords (Crowsaders: Full Metal Jackdaw), the mutants of North America live aboard trains to avoid extinction (United Stations of America), and in India, the last vestiges of ‘pure humanity’ live beneath the tyrannical power of a government that determines the seasons (Sights of Sun).

Meanwhile, a majority of humans have fled Earth, settling on the planets of Olbercuse, Etria, and Lovecraft.  Olbercuse is broken in time, past and future constantly switching places, which makes it an excellent place to try out time travel (and for the goddess of parties to try her hand at getting ‘serious’ for a change’) (Scorchmarks and Party Up).  Violence on Etria is solved via bloody card games (In the Cards), and Lovecraft’s strange atmosphere causes emotion to take physical shape (it is then promptly fed to city-sized insects atop which humanity built its cities) (Psychosis).

Experimentation on Olbercuse and Lovecraft has also given rise to some parallel dimensions based in the primary timeline (Glass Stilettos, PatchNotes, Quest Log, Dev Kit), while other groups of humans continue to explore and settle the stars (The Bonecutter’s Curse)!

Aaaand here’s a link to a google drive with the promised PDFs to 7 of them (plus a little nudge towards Feeding America)!  I’ve got more description for my chosen 7 below!

Crowsaders: Full Metal Jackdaw - A crow who loves fire wields a sentient sword to defeat dual-wielding eagles who want to conquer Europe using fusion technology.  God I love this one.  It’s so dumb.  There are so many bird puns.

Flight of the Pheasant King - Children’s Book - A girl goes on a cross-country journey with a talking pheasant to find her missing mother and defeat the pheasant king’s evil rival.  Inspired by the Iranian Shahnameh (sort of like a Iranian Labors of Hercules).  More info on the Shahnameh here.

Glass Stilettos - A frustrated young woman travels to a parallel world to help the god of false smiles prevent true love at any cost (sort of a reverse-fairy-godmother situation, with a silkpunk setting where China got steam-rifles).  You can read it in present tense or past tense (past tense is the ‘true version’ but present tense exists for those who want it).

PatchNotes - Set in the same world as Quest Log, a professional liar fights for his life when Chicago is turned into an RPG by a mysterious god-turned-game-developer.  Sorta involves him making up his own religion and getting a lotta people onboard.

Quest Log - After Charleston is turned into a magic-filled wasteland by a god-turned-game-developer, a Navy officer tries to keep her team of trainees alive while facing a prophetic enemy - also available on \[Barnes and Noble for free\] ([https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/quest-log-dallas-woodward/1137771984;jsessionid=84FF474D180402D20B8FA71F6A7439B7.prodny\_store02-atgap08?ean=2940164554415](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/quest-log-dallas-woodward/1137771984;jsessionid=84FF474D180402D20B8FA71F6A7439B7.prodny_store02-atgap08?ean=2940164554415)) or \[Amazon\] ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KCJQVKW](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KCJQVKW))

804,Fantasy,Not liking the idea of Bingo...,"I was initially a little put off by Bingo.  I just read what I want to read, why would I want to artifically constrain myself?  This isn't a job or a chore and people even start getting anxious sometimes 'cause they aren't meeting their goals.  It certainly **looks** like it's not very fun, right?  

So, I wasn't super interested in it, but then around July a couple years ago I sat down and started plugging in books I'd read normally into categories and started playing ""Bingo tetris"" to figure out the optimum placement of my books.  I mean there WERE prizes on the line, could I make this work?  Hardcore geek session later I was like ""shit, I'm 2/3 of the way there, guess I could continue.""

So I finished that year and by then I'd come up with a whole list of reasons why Bingo is actually one of my favorite parts of my reading hobby.  So I guess here's my love letter to it...

---

My favorite experience from that first year was that I actually found one of my new favorite books ever and I would never have read it if not for Bingo.  It was a Magical Realism book which...is not my jam.  But in the recommendation thread someone mentioned Garden Spells by Sarah Addison Allen and I knew that was sitting on one of my spouse's bookshelves so I figured I'd give it a shot and maybe even have something to talk with her about.  And I'll be damned if I haven't read everything Allen has written now and listened to almost all of them in audiobook too at this point.  They are great books and you should read them.

And it is VERY rare for me to find a book I love so to find a path that got me to one...I was hooked.  And as time went on I've continued to develop reasons.  One of those is the light stress that comes from participating.  There is some ""chore-ness"" to it sometimes but I also like watching horror movies that stress me out.  For me, it spices up my ""what do I read next"" quite a bit.  How many categories does this fit?  Should I go ""off bingo"" for this one?  If I really want to read something I'm going to do it and categories be damned but this has actually lead to another thing I love...

Stress reduction!  Which seems counter-intuitive but I've got over 500 books on my TBR shelf and trying to find ""what do I read next"" can be stressful as hell.  Choice paralysis is absolutely a thing.  So for a good chunk of the year, starting in April, I've got a baked in reduction of that list to the things that fit Bingo categories - preferably as many as possible 'cause Bingo Tetris is fun as hell.  And then when I finish Bingo I go check out the things that didn't fit Bingo that I've continued to think about it.  So that push/pull of flirting with going off bingo and using bingo to give myself some more defined guardrails...it works really well for me.  But when I do go off bingo...

Oh! The surprises!  With a little creativity you can fill some categories with some interesting choices.  Like a ""has a library"" category...I did that with Sundiver by David Brin because it turns out it featured a branch of the Galactic Library on Earth .  Why can't ""features an ocean"" not be an ocean contained in a miles long artifical gravity sphere that sentient octopus' created so they can do interstellar travel like in &gt;!Children of Ruin!&lt; by Adrian Tchaikovsky?  I've been amazed how many times I go off and read a book and come back to Bingo only to realize they fit a number of things.

And diversity of choosing nowadays too.  Comparing my reading habits of early 2010's compared to now I was very much a victim of what I've decided to call ""genre inertia.""  I had a type and, man, it was pretty obvious.  It wasn't intentional but we all find ourselves in comfortable ruts, right?  Whether that's the same types of games or movies or anything.  But in the last handful of years I'm much happier with how I've stretched myself.  Bingo started kicking me out of that rut.  I read more varied stuff, I find out new things that I enjoy and deepen my understanding of what I don't like as well.  I see Bingo as a legitimate tool for self-improvement and I'm all about things that are ""good for you"" while also being fun as hell.

Anyways, I'm running long here with my love letter but I just thought I'd toss this out there.  And maybe there's very few people that are at all interested in it but...I get thinking it sounds like no fun.  So did I!  But I'm really glad I was bored that day five years ago at work and gave it a shot.

So, see you in two days Bingo 2021."

[Half a Soul](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52654173-half-a-soul) is [Olivia Atwater](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20153683.Olivia_Atwater)'s debut novel.

This standalone book is part of the [Regency Faerie Tales](https://www.goodreads.com/series/285776-regency-faerie-tales) series.

## Blurb

**It’s difficult to find a husband in Regency England when you’re a young lady with only half a soul.**

Ever since a faerie cursed her, Theodora Ettings has had no sense of fear, embarrassment, or even happiness—a condition which makes her sadly prone to accidental scandal. Dora’s only goal for the London Season this year is to stay quiet and avoid upsetting her cousin’s chances at a husband… but when the Lord Sorcier of England learns of her condition, she finds herself drawn ever more deeply into the tumultuous concerns of magicians and faeries.

Lord Elias Wilder is handsome, strange, and utterly uncouth—but gossip says that he regularly performs three impossible things before breakfast, and he is willing to help Dora restore her missing half. If Dora’s reputation can survive both her ongoing curse and her sudden connection with the least-liked man in all of high society, then she may yet reclaim her normal place in the world… but the longer Dora spends with Elias Wilder, the more she begins to suspect that one may indeed fall in love, even with only half a soul.

*Pride and Prejudice* meets *Howl’s Moving Castle* in this enthralling historical fantasy romance, where the only thing more meddlesome than faeries is a marriage-minded mama. Pick up *Half a Soul*, and be stolen away into debut author Olivia Atwater’s charming, magical version of Regency England!

## Review

I have read romantic 💖 fantasy before, but I do not typically look for such books to read. As part of the [/r/Fantasy/ bingo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ft254j/official_rfantasy_2020_book_bingo_challenge/) challenge, I was looking to juggle my books around to avoid more than one novella in my card. So, when 'Half a Soul' came up as part of HEA club and had awesome reviews already, I picked it up. I ended up using the book for Canadian square though.

This was quite a lovely book. Finished it in less than a day. Characters, setting, plot, pacing - all of them combined well to give a delightful experience. The banter was awesome and felt natural.

The prologue didn't catch my attention much, but by the end of first two chapters, I was turning pages in a hurry. Lot of secondary characters getting their due and focus was another aspect that I loved about this book. In hindsight, this was evident from the first chapter itself, and this continued to be such a refreshing feature that it left a big impression on me.

*My rating:* 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

### What others are saying

From [Weatherwax Report blog](https://weatherwaxreport.blog/2020/08/04/half-a-soul-by-olivia-atwater/):

&gt;I think the banter was probably one of the best parts of the book, the dialogue was witty, fast-moving, and believable. The writing style itself was light and breezy and made for easy listening. I found the narrator to be a great choice with a nice tone for the story and lightly done voices. The pacing was extremely quick despite the lack of action sequences and things of that nature. It was a quick book, coming in around 250 pages it took me just a few short reading sessions to finish it. I could have been done in one go if I had the time.

From [superstardrifter blog](https://superstardrifter.com/2020/11/18/review-half-a-soul-by-olivia-atwater/):

&gt;All told, I had a wonderful time with the whole thing, and I recommend it to anyone that likes a fantasy romance, a regency romance, or a fantasy of manners. This one combines pretty much all three of those things into one delightful package. I had 5/5 stars of a good time with this one! I can’t wait to read the next story in the series!

From [Dianthaa's review on /r/Fantasy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/m0j2md/mini_reviews_half_a_soul_root_magic_midnight/):

&gt;This was a HEA bookclub read and it was delightful. Short, sweet, funny, charming, everything I look for in a Romance novel, I couldn’t put it down. The dynamic between the romantic leads is so fun and bantery, I couldn’t get enough of them. I loved the way only having half a soul affected Dora, she was still sweet but very emotionally detached from everything. And of course, what made her awkward in society made her a perfect match for the love interest, cause she wasn’t taking any of his bullshit. The book also featured faeries, which I always love. I liked how even though it’s a fluffy romance, it didn’t shy away from the harsh realities of the times, and how that was something that brought the main couple together. I was very happy with how the book tied up loose ends for the secondary characters too.

# Fifth Row

## Novel with a Number in the Title : Only One Death by Alexander M Crow

Short, well paced, engaging. The plot was enough to get my interest going quickly and the characters were nice to read about.
There is a bit of a mystery and the novel ends satisfyingly. 

Also : Great title :)

I did not highlight a quote for this one :(

★★★☆☆

## Romantic Fantasy / Paranormal Romance : The Demons We See by Krista D Ball

My first novel by Krista D Ball.
I was dreading the ""Romance"" square but was pleasantly surprised. I liked it and read the follow up novel. 
This book suffers from one thing : Everyone on the ""good"" side is just a bit too perfect to be real. Too understanding, too nice, too friendly...
It's a flaw it shares with ""Mage Errant"" books reviewed bellow. It might be a personal pet peeve but characters that are too ""Wholesome"" always make me feel weird.

I prefered the short story I read by Krista D Ball (Giant Rights) and will probably pick up another of her books for the 2021 bingo if I can make it fit.

★★★☆☆

## Magical Pet : The Lost City of Ithos by John Bierce

Another great addition to the series. Although it suffers a bit from the ""these people are too wholesome to be believable"" I really enjoy the series.
You can tell the authors puts a lot of imagination in the world as it unfolds a bit in each book and is always satisfying.
I liked how the book ends with a tiny essay about tiggers, it makes me feel like anything in this book has been thoroughly researched and analysed.

I highly recommend the book series, it seems to get better and better with each book.

Quote : 
&gt; Sphinxes are not cats, any more than they are birds or humans. But they share traits of all three.

★★★★☆

## Graphic Novel or Audiobook : Les fiancées de l'hiver by Christelle Dabos

Another YA french book. It's alright but not great. We don't have an amazing selection of audiobooks in french like audible has in english.
The characters tends to be a bit annoying and they skim over some pretty severe physical abuse as ""She was in a bad mood please forgive her"" and don't get into it again.

We almost finished the series (I listened with my partner) but gave up in the end. The story was intriguing but was not enough to carry the series in the end. Also the books get worse over time in the series.

Quote : 
&gt; Oublier les morts, c'était un peu comme les tuer une seconde fois

&gt; Forgetting the dead is a bit like killing them a second time.

★★★☆☆

## Featuring Politics : How To Rule An Empire and Get Away With It by KJ Parker

Loved it. It's the second in a series and it's as awesome as the first one was. I discovered KJ parker last year and I really really like the byzantine inspired settings and the prose where he speaks to the reader. Page turner for me and I finished it very quickly.

Since I started reading KJ Parker I have bought every new release and liked all of them.

&gt;*Touraine is a soldier. Stolen as a child and raised to kill and die for the empire, her only loyalty is to her fellow conscripts. But now, her company has been sent back to her homeland to stop a rebellion, and the ties of blood may be stronger than she thought.*

*Through assassinations and massacres, in bedrooms and war rooms, Touraine and Luca will haggle over the price of a nation. But some things aren’t for sale.*

I’ve been putting off this review because I feel like it deserves smart thoughtful analysis, because it’s a smart thoughtful book looking at complicated issues, but I just keep getting stuck on those arms, so:

First, to get this out of the way: Those ARMS!

That cover am I right? Raise your hands if you’re interested in this book because of those arms, I know I was. So I went in not knowing anything about the book other than buff sapphic lady on the cover. And I thought it might be like a fun campy book cause the only comparison I had was Gideon, nope. It is a very different kind of book, and one I personally enjoyed a lot more. There is a good amount of ladies thirsting over those arms, so I was not disappointed.

So what is the book actually like? Thirst aside?

It’s a very thoughtful, detailed look at colonialism, inspired by French colonialism in North Africa. The book is politics-heavy, and the main characters spend a lot of time dealing with how they feel about everything that’s going on. And I really liked how that played out, because neither Touraine nor Luca know really where they stand when the book begins and figuring that out is messy and complicated.

The story is set about a generation after Luca’s dad, leading the Balladairan empire, conquered the Qazāli land. Luca is here trying to prove her worth by quelling the local rebellion. Touraine is a Sand, an army conscript stolen as a child and raised to be a soldier. She hasn’t been back here since she was a child, and now she is torn between her loyalty to the empire and shadows of her past. They both struggle with their place in the empire and this colonial dynamic.

Luca and Touraine had an assigned role and initially, they weren’t really questioning it, and then things kept happening and challenging them. The ways they adapted often involved a lot of fuck-ups and was messy and very human. There were some points where this could’ve been interpreted as idiotball, but  I thought everything fit very well to the character’s conflicting motivations and loyalties. I liked their relationship too, they’re clearly drawn to each other, but there’s the whole power difference between them, and often working towards different goals. The world is queernorm, so they don’t get any trouble for both being women, and there are many sapphic couples in the story.

Touraine’s the star of the show, and I was with her all way, even when her choices were strange. But Luca is also very interesting because she starts off nice, and wanting to help and reform, but the more she came to terms with her motivations, the less I liked her.

As a side note, I really liked how much history was woven into the story, and how it tied in with the magic and lack thereof. Past conflicts still have real consequences in the present. I really liked the bits about the empire that fell before the Badelarian empire expanded, and I’d love to read more about that. What we do learn of the magic is very mysterious, and I’m into that.

I’m not sure if this is a problem of the book, or a feature of dealing with heavy complicated subjects and feelings, but it was a pretty slow read. Things are harsh often it seems like whatever the characters chose people would suffer. So I was in this odd place where I liked it whenever I read it, and thought the way it showed colonialism from different perspectives and everyone having their own goals and reasons was very smart, but I didn’t find myself picking it up that easily.

All in all I strongly recommend this and I think it’s going to be among my favorites of the year, it’s really stuck with me, with the caveat that it’s not a light easy read.

**Recommended for:** fans of historical fantasy with colonialist focus and buff women

I am quite the normal bookdragon, I have a personal fluffy black hole (a.k.a. my TBR) that is constantly growing and that constantly tries to eat me whole. There are so many books on there, and some of them are there since forever, but thanks to the Bingo I got the opportunity to read some of them, and I discovered some pretty amazing new authors and books, too! So... here is the second part of my card!

**A Novel Set in School** *A Deadly Education by N. Novik* This book was a surprise. I have read a couple of other books by this author and I wasn't so impressed. I cannot say that they were bad but I didn't love them either. So I started this one with pretty low expectations. Sure, the idea sounded good but... yes, but the same could have been said for the other books by her I have read. And it blow me away! I loved this school, is really original and an interesting and creepy place. And I loved El. She is not your usual MC, and I adored her!

**Book About Books** *The Left-Handed Booksellers of London by G. Nix* I think this was the square that I liked less, but I don't really know why. It is just that I am not a big fan of books about books (even if I love books!!!), so I decided to go with a book that made me quite curious. And this went okay, I guess. I enjoyed the book, especially the characters, but I wasn't really hooked up. The beginning was pretty good, and I was interested but around the halfway point I lost interest for the plot. It wasn't boring, but it wasn't so compelling, either. I was expecting something more, but it is all the same a good book, especially if you are in for something different! 

**That Made You Laugh** *Saint's Blood by S. De Castell* Okay, this may not be your usual choice, I give you that. But I had to use at least a book in this series for this square because there is so much in this series. And yes, it is not funny per se. We get a lot of bad things happening, and the author is quite bad with our MCs (bad author, no cookies!!!), he hurts them so much!!! But with all the tears and the hurt, I had laughed out loud and smiled. So much. Because Falcio, Kest, and Basti are amazing. And they would make you laugh, too! (And cry, and scream, but these are details!)

**Short Stories** *Swashbuckling Cats* this anthology was pretty fun. And it is full of cats!!! You cannot ask for more, really!

**Big Dumb Object** *The Collapsing Empire by J. Scalzi* I discovered this author thanks to this series, and I know that this won't be the last I'll read of him. This was such an amazing series!
And this book in particular is the first, where all the things began. We get to know some interesting characters and quite some action. It is a fast reading, and the best part are the dialogues. So so good!!!!

**Feminist Novel** *Snowspelled by S. Burgis* I discovered this author thanks to this Bingo, and it was such a great surprise! This is a short book, but it has some pretty great characters, and the world-building is pretty intriguing, too. I loved it! 

**By A Canadian Author** *Under Heaven by G. Gavriel Kay* I had this book on my shelves, and it was there waiting for its turn since a lifetime, or so it seemed. And it would have waited for a long time still if I didn't need it for this square. This is the first book I have read by this author, and I have mixed feelings toward it. On one hand, this is not my cup of tea, it is not my kind of story and I had a hard time to really feel the characters. On the other hand, I enjoyed the time I have spent with it. It is a story beautifully told. And it was interesting. So, I enjoyed it, and it surprised me, but I won't go on with this series anyway.

**With A Number In The Title** *Three Mages and A Margarita by A. Marie* I discovered this series on a blog that I follow, and I had to try it because I was curious and it seemed like my cup of tea. And I fell in love with it. This book is fast, fun, and quite a good comfort reading. It may not be the best book ever, but I had an amazing time with it, and in the end, this is the important thing.

**Paranormal Romance** *The Dirt on The Ninth Grave by D. Jones* I think that this series should have ended a couple of books ago. Once upon a time, I loved these books, but I think that with the birth of  Charley's daughter the story should have ended. They are still fast books, but I think that they lost traction, and I am quite undecided about keeping it going or dropping it.

**With a Magical Pet** *Midnight Light Blue Special by S. McGuire* I think that I am keeping up with this series for the Aeslin Mices. They are just the most amazing thing ever! And the world-building in this series is so rich and fascinating. I really love it. But I don't particularly care for the characters. I don't know what really is not working for me, and I cannot say that they are bad books, I enjoyed them so far, but not loved them.

**Graphic Novel** *Black Butler vl. 18 by Y. Toboso* I love this manga, and this volume is one of the ones with the story arc of the boarding school. Ciel and Sebastian in a boarding school were just so good! And the art is superb.

**Featuring Politics** *The Demons We See by K. D. Ball* This was another of the books that I discovered thanks to the Bingo. And I think this was the best surprise of all. I loved this first book, Allegra is so far from your usual main character, because she is what she should be. I mean, she is a noblewoman who makes the noblewoman. She write letters, she play her part in society (not always willingly, maybe), she makes herself heard with the meaning and the resources of a noble. She is not secretly a thief/spy/assassin/whatever. And mind me, I love this kind of books, but sometimes it is refreshing to see something different. And Allegra is different. And this book is different. And I loved it. (And also the sequel. It is amazing too!)

And now I am really looking forward to the next year's Bingo!"
821,Fantasy,Any recommendations?,"Looking for something to read. Am a big fan of Joe Abercrombie, Scott Lynch etc, but not necessarily opposed to something with more fantasy elements, or with a more optimistic tone. Also a fan of political intrigue and skullduggery, bonus points if it's not solely dominated by white men. Would be really interested in something based around the themes of revolution and political change."
822,Fantasy,Kind of specific but... A book where the main character has some kind of physical transformation/mutation after gaining their power/magic?,A give up your humanity in exchange for power type deal. The best example I can think of is how Eragon got turned part elf in the Inheritance Cycle and it sort of alienated him from his family.
823,Fantasy,Reviewing everything I read - March II + Quarter 1 STATS,"One goal I had this yeah is to review evertyhing I read this year here. Im finishin March a bit early as it's a holiday here (Passover) and the chances I'll finish something are really low but (and there's bingo to think about now) if I will it'll be in the April reviews - 

Previeusly I reviewd what I read in [January (coommnt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/l9ctr1/january_reading_list_i_share_mine_you_share_yours/glhxax7/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)), [February part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ljmarz/minirveiew_of_what_ive_read_in_february_so_far/) and [part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ly8xbl/reviewing_everything_ive_read_in_february_part_ii/) and [March part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/m5gsyv/reviewing_everything_i_read_march_part_i_lots_of/)

Before we begin the reviews let's look at some stats (yeahhh) - 

So far in 2021 I've read/listened to 41 books that are split to 30 novels, 10 novellas and 1 anthology. (+5 short stories which Im pretty much gonan ignore from here lol as it's hard for me to calculate them with the rest of the stuff) 

16 novels and 8 novellas were written by female authors, 13 novels, the anthology and 1 novela were wtritten by male authors (+ The Original that was a M/F cooperation and The Mask of Mirrors that was written by a woman and a non-binary person).

I've listened to 22 novels, 1 anthology and 2 novellas in audiobook and read with my eyes 8 novels and 8 novellas. 

I've read 27 different authors (16 of those were new to me). The one author I've read the most from is John Scalzi (4 novels 1 novella) with Seanan McGuire in the second place with 4 novellas.

I've read 20 novels and 7 novellas that I'd consider fantasy with 9 novels and 3 novella I'll call Sci-Fi and one last novel that I'd categorise as a Horror/Thriller. 

Year of publishing - I've read 14 books that was published in 2020, 8 in 2019 and after that it's tied with 3 for 2021, 2017, and 2014. aside from 3 books everything I read was published after 2012.

The avarege year of publishing is 2016.63. (2 outliers Pratchett books fron 1988 1990 - if I avarege without those it'll be 2018.05). 

OKayy I think we arrived at the point  in which I shoud stop. 

Let's review the second part of march lol. 

**It's 2059' and the Rich Kids are Still Winning by Ted Chiang** (short story, ebook) - I searched for more of Chaing story and this one was for free on the interner so yeah. It's really short and pretty depressing tho probably accurate. I do recommend reading it. I don't rate short stories so no rating. 

**As Tight as any Knot by M.A Carrick** (short story, audiobook) - Found it in Marie Brennan website while looking at Lady Trent stuff. A short story in the world of The Mask of Mirrors (also free for both ebook and audiobook) which was really cool and interesting look at few characters from TMOM. Really recommend to everyone wether you read TMOM or not. 

**Dragon Mage by M.L Spencer** (ebook) - What can I say, you all were right. What an excelent book. I loved Aram (I have an autistic brother and I definetly saw some of him in Aram) and Marcus and the story was written beautiflly. If you haven't picked it up already after everyone on the sub talked about it you really should. 5/5. 

**Sins of Empire by Brian McClellan** (audiobook) - I was prettly meh on the Powder Mage trilogy but then this was in a sale so I thought why not and tried it. I can already say that this is better then the first trilogy, really enjoyed both the old charcter and the new ones. It's still mostly action and cool gun stuff buy it was a fun read. 3.5/5

**In An Absent Dream by Seanan McGuire** (novella, ebook) - Is it just me or is this series keep getting better, this was such a beutiful and heartbreaking story even with knowing the end from the beginning (tho if you havent read the first novella yet you can start from this one as it's a prequel). Im reallly happy I started this series and will definetly read more of McGuire books. 5/5.

**I am Not A Serial Killer by Dan Wells** (audiobook) - another book I picked up by accident (sale and I saw Dan Wells at one of Sanderson streams) and ended up fairly enjoying. It's a horror/thriller but Im putting it here as it does have fantasy elements. This was a concept that I saw A LOT from (a Sociopath kid as the protagonist) but with a cool murder mystery it was pretty fun and I wanted a non-SFF book because bingo is coming so it was fine. Probably won't continue with the series tho. 3/5

**Lock In by John Scalzi** (audiobook) - this is another detective style story that happening in our world but after a huge pandemic that affected everything and everyone (yes it is, no, it was written in 2014 I checked twice). I loved the charcters (and the cool trick when Scalzi dont tell us the gender of the protagonist - I've listened to the female narrator version of this and it's cool that it have another one) overall it's a Scalzi book of course I liked it. 4/5.

**Unlocked: An Oral History of Haden's Syndrome by John Scalzi** (novella, audiobook) - So In the end of the book I found out that I also get the novella that is kind of a documentry on the pandemic. First of all YAY, the production value of this is amazing with a LOT of narrators with everyone doing a very good job, and the novella itself was really excellent. 5/5."
824,Fantasy,Authors/books for those with Aphantasia?,"I have recently concluded that I am 99% I have Aphantasia. Which means I cannot visualise an image in my mind. I will never have an image of what a character or place looks like.

It explains my frustration with books that are heavy on beautiful descriptions of people and places. I tend to get stuck or bored because it all does nothing for me. 

I love reading and have read LOTS of fantasy throughout my life but find I am very happy with books that are light on detailed descriptions and heavy on dialogue (I love lots of dialogue), actions and emotions and ideas. 

I do well with authors like Hemingway.  

I also get on very well with old fashioned story telling because prose that does lots of showing shows me nothing. 


Does anybody have any suggestions of authors for me that might suit me?"

826,Fantasy,"The Dominance of Avatar in Asian Fantasy, and possible implications in the Future","Much like Tolkien was the Father of European Fantasy, I think Avatar is now the Father of Asian Fantasy. You know how people say Tolkien is always looming in the background of Fantasy? Raya just proved that about Avatar, you cannot ignore Avatar if you make anything that is Asian Fantasy. It is the De Facto Example of Asian Fantasy. Everything that will ever be made with an Asian setting will always be viewed through the lens of ""How Avatar Like is it?"".

I don't think there's ever going to any Asian Fantasy property ever that will escape the gravity well of Avatar. Much like how for Tolkien you can play it straight like Shannara, subvert it like WoT, or poke fun at it like Discworld, that's all you can do about Avatar for now. Raya, I think played it pretty straight. Now we wait for the next few Decades for the WoT and ASOIAF of Asian Fantasy to breathe life into the Mainstream Asian Fantasy Genre.

As someone who is Asian, I feel sad about this? Like the ""best"" Asian Fantasy isn't from us, it's from the US. Asian Fantasy is now codified as the ""Avatar-like"" genre in the mainstream consciousness when there's so much more to Asian Fantasy than just Avatar, and now I'm afraid of the implications of what people would think Asia is like. They won't think of Ken Liu's Grace of Kings, or Kuang's Poppy War, or Yang's Black Tides of Heaven. They'll call it ""Avatar + Three Kingdoms"" ""Avatar but during the Opium Wars"" ""Avatar but LGBT"". I'm scared that the voices that wish to give life and magic to how Asians view the magic and culture of Asia would get sidelined because it won't be Avatar-like enough for the taste of the majority of the world.

I wonder if we ever get some Silkpunk Adaptations if people would call them Avatar Rip offs? Maybe it's just me, maybe I should be thankful that Avatar even gave Asia some representation on the world Stage."

829,Fantasy,I need help locating a reddit story (fictitious) that I only remember events of,"As best as I can recall, the story begins with a male soldier fighting in a war somewhere in the middle east (unsure), and there is a mysterious asteroid/egg thing that falls from the sky and emits this vast darkness around it. Military orders send them in to see whats going on, so they set up a chain of light stands and venture into the darkness. Its implied that the higher ups know whats going on, but are sacrificing the cannon fodder. The darkness is penetrable in short range, and no one can see anything beyond the 20 feet of light around each light source, but they can hear things in the darkness. They eventually reach a point where they see themselves, and realize theres a gigantic mirrored body of something. I believe they continued on, or desert at some point before returning and are punished in the ""heatbox"" which is just a metal box that lets all the heat in and you sit in it for hours--eventually they reach the egg part, I dont remember what comes next, though. I do recall there being a mass exodus of people from different ""worlds"" and essentially ""parallel dimensions/universes"" and there being like a main city kind of ""world"" that has a golden shield that protects it, but the darkness eating the outer worlds are encroaching on it and destroying the shield as well. Thats all I can remember. I appreciate any help!  It might be on nosleep, now that I think about it, but I am not too sure."

I don’t think I’ve ever picked up any fantasy book that kinda has the plot centered around one particular mystery at its core.

Both these characters have done many things considered evil. We can feel the hatred and prejudice in their heads, choke on the thoughts that grind the better emotions down to chalk dust.

845,Fantasy,Riordan Retrospective: The Serpent’s Shadow,"Riordan Retrospective: The Serpent’s Shadow

Welcome once again to the Riordan Retrospective.  For those of you just joining the fun, this is my look back at the works of Rick Riordan.  This is less of a formal review, and more of a look back, along with my thoughts and observations.  This time we’re taking a look back at book three of The Kane Chronicles, The Serpent’s Shadow. [The Serpent’s Shadow ](https://www.amazon.com/Serpents-Shadow-Kane-Chronicles-Book/dp/1423142020/ref=nodl_)

This is the moment everything has been building up to.  The final showdown with Apophis is at hand, and the House of Life is about to make its last stand against the forces of chaos.  There isn't really much more I can add, so let's jump directly to my thoughts.  Also, as usual, there's going to be plenty of spoilers.  Turn back now if you want to avoid that sort of thing. 

Before we get any further, I'd like to address something I should have brought up in previous retrospectives: where Mr. and Mrs. Kane married?  We know that after Mrs. Kane died her parents fought Mr. Kane for custody of Carter and Sadie.  The only way that would be even remotely possible is if Julius and Ruby hadn't been married; if you don't get married, and your spouse dies, then their parents can fight you for custody of your kids.  The only other scenario is if the parent is severely negligent and/or abusive, and that's certainly not the case here.

It only gets more complicated when you consider that Ruby's parents are British, and now your dragging international law into it.  And they couldn't expect to just say ""Julius is unfit to be a parent because his lifestyle as a magician who fights gods and monsters puts these children at risk"" without the judge laughing them out of court.  Also, why did they only get Sadie, and Mr. Kane only got Carter?  Wouldn't the judge want to keep the siblings together? 

The whole affair always just never made sense to me.  Speaking of familial relations, let's talk about Setne.  He is bound to Carter and Sadie's service as punishment for his crimes against the gods.  This, along with the fact that he later betrays them, is rather odd.  Setne was an actual historical figure, specifically he was the son of Ramses the Great.  He was beloved by the people of Ancient Egypt, a faithful servant of the gods and considered a hero. Granted, you could argue that he did so in a chaotic way, which the gods wouldn't approve of, but it is still rather odd for him to be portrayed as a villain. 

As I've previously mentioned, I kind of figured that Sadie's love triangle would be resolved by Walt becoming the host of Anubis.  Walt will be the Eye of Anubis, and Anubis will be a living god like the pharaohs of old.  Apparently, the more time they spend like that the more their personalities will merge together.  I guess it's kind of like the end of the second Rosario+Vampire manga where Inner Moka and Outer Moka combine to form a composite Moka.  Alternatively, it's kind of like how Mr. Kane and Osiris are pretty much one and the same.  Does that mean Carter and Sadie are, technically, children of Osiris?   

On that topic, back in the first book Rick tried to dance around the fact that Isis and Osiris were brother and sister, but also husband and wife.  It was explained as one time a brother and sister hosted them, and then a husband and wife hosted them.  Yeah, that didn't happen in the original myths, but I understand why he did that.  Egyptian Mythology is...kind of full of incest, which isn't a very family-friendly topic, so yeah.  

We finally get an answer to a question I'd been wondering for a while: what happens to atheists when they die in the Riordanverse?  Apparently, they don't see anything, at least if they default to the Egyptian afterlife.  We are told this, and yet it's contradicted by the text itself.  We see a man being judged who didn't believe in any gods, but had a love of Ancient Egypt, and he can see everything perfectly fine.  That was my personal take on the matter; if you don't have any strong convictions you ought to default to whatever the dominant pantheon is wherever you happen to be.  

So, moving to lighter subjects, during Sadie and friends' dance we get a surprise cameo by Drew Tanaka and Lacy from The Heroes of Olympus.  The Kane Chronicles does take places in the same universe as Percy Jackson/The Heroes of Olympus, but I gotta admit, I wasn't expecting characters from the other series to appear.  Then, of course, there were the official crossovers, but that's a topic for another time.  As previously mentioned, I liked Set's reasoning for fighting with the other gods.  He may be the god of chaos, but he views himself as someone who shakes things up and breaks old patterns.  Apophis, by contrast, just wants to destroy everything.

As with the previous installment, the series takes a more international approach than Percy Jackson does.  Besides some early scenes in Dallas and Brooklyn, almost all of the scenes on Earth take place in Egypt.  By sear coincidence, this part of the series came out not too long after the Arab Spring happened.  I wonder if, in the Riordanverse, Apophis had a hand in all of that. Good thing the series came out when it did; any later and it would have been pretty difficult to have scenes set in Egypt.  Hmm, I wonder if Apophis also had a hand in creating the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  Did he convince them to pick that name in order to defame the goddess Isis?  

Also, it's mentioned that Dallas Museum of Art was hosting a King Tut exhibit.  A few years before this book came out, it really did.  In fact, my family took a trip to Dallas to see it.  King Tut, however, was not actually at the exhibit, which was mildly disappointing.  Still, it was great to see all of the Egyptian artifacts, many of which I'd only seen in books before that.  Kind of cool to think my counterpart in the Riordanverse might have bumped into Carter and Sadie.  Well, Apophis did kill all of the magicians at the Dallas nome, meaning I might have wound up as collateral damage so...yeah.  

While we're speculating, let's talk about Thoth.  We know that he was the only god the House of Life didn't banish in ancient times.  It is said that they did this because he's the god of magic, and thus their patron and founder.  What if there's more to it than just that?  Without the other gods around he'd get all of the prayers and offerings, and potentially more power, so what if he was behind the banishment of all the other gods?  The Riordanverse version of Thoth might act silly and scatterbrained, but maybe, just maybe, he just might be the biggest chess master in the entire Riordanverse. 

I gotta admit, when the series started off I really wasn't sure about Sadie, but she grew on me.  I honestly feel like I witnessed her grow as a character.  At the start of the series she's very rude and brash, but does so as a coping mechanism to hide her insecurities.  By series end she's calmed down and matured a bit.  She accept that her life won't ever be normal, but that's okay, because she's a magician of the House of Life.  I really like how she embraced the magical and otherworldly part of her life, rather than pining after a ""normal"" teenage life.  She also finally got around to using polytheistic swearing.  

As was prophesied at the start of the series, Carter becomes the first pharaoh in over 2000 years, but leaves most of the day to day affairs to Uncle Amos.  Carter has never loved the spotlight, in large part because of his upbringing.  He never got to do typical kid things because he was always traveling with his dad.  Unlike many other Riordanverse characters, he didn't really ever have a taste of ""normal"" life.  I like to think that eventually he'll learn to accept his life as it is like Sadie did.  

So we all knew Apophis was going to be defeated, but it was a fun ride to get there.  Unfortunately, since order cannot exist without chaos, the gods will be withdrawing from the world as well.  That is rather sad, especially given how nice, for the most part, they tend to be.  Still, at least Carter and Sadie can visit them in the Duat.  And hey, Anubis gets to stay because Walt is hosting him as his eye.  

As I've previously mentioned, one of the drawbacks to The Kane Chronicles only being three-books-long is that the minor characters don't get as much time to shine.  For example, in this book we meet a young Russian magician named Leonid who learn the Path of Shu, god of the wind, against the wishes of his nome.  He felt a bit underutilized.  On a more positive note, Felix finally found his magic: ice magic!  That combined with his love of penguins, will probably make him the only magician who actually wants to be assigned to the Antarctica nome.  The Egyptian Pantheon doesn't have a snow deity, so I don't know which Path of the Gods he'll be taking.

The book ends with Sadie mentioning that mysterious magical activity has been discovered on Long Island, and that an investigation will be commencing soon.  Obviously, this is setting things up for the crossover short stories collection Demigods &amp; Magicians. 

Speaking of audiobooks, for one final time, I'm going to plug the audiobook version of The Serpent's Shadow. [The Serpent’s Shadow ](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Serpents-Shadow-The-Kane-Chronicles-Book-3-Audiobook/B007T8F49I?qid=1536549050&amp;sr=sr_1_1&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&amp;pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&amp;pf_rd_r=NEYM9C1N179RWRC1TSN8&amp;)

Well, I think it's time I gave my overall thoughts on The Kane Chronicles.  Like I said in the Red Pyramid retrospective, not a perfect series, and I admit some of my objections are unique to me, but overall not a bad series.  It doesn't quite have the charm of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, but it is still well worth reading.  Who knows, you just might learn something new about Egyptian Mythology and/or Ancient Egyptian History.  

For one final times, let's analyze the old cover [the old cover](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ewAFixwNSyg/W5XeliCuY5I/AAAAAAAABDM/YG4VRRl7IgwGnOXksZuQ2oFzuyOrDwZDgCLcBGAs/s1600/9780545594318_mres.jpg).  We see Carter and Sadie deep within the Duat.  They're admits the primordial sea of chaos and are making their way to the very first land, where Ma'at, given form by the obelisk, shines bright.  Apophis looms ominously in the clouds. 

The new cover [The new cover](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rd8F3Dca6i8/W5XfMFCOvyI/AAAAAAAABDU/nme_dOa5QIYjVT1nRZ1U5XM5HIfuoPFNQCLcBGAs/s1600/Kane-SERPENT-SHADOW-cover-final.72-1.jpg) is...actually, it's not half bad.  We see Carter and Sadie standing in front of the Pyramids of Giza as Apophis rises out of the sands.  Easily the best of the new covers, even if it doesn't quite have the charm of the original.

847,Fantasy,What do you think of my Fantasy/ Supernatural Webtoon?,
848,Fantasy,"I feel like lord of the rings is one of those things I should enjoy reading, but just don't for some reason."," 

I read the first lord of the rings book, before the movies ever existed when I was a young teenager. I wouldn't say I'm missing out. The books are way too vague and skim through a lot of stuff. They do not detail the chacterizations and battles as much as I'd like. Books I've liked are the malazan series and mistborn. Books I've disliked are the middle half of wheel of time because it's the opposite extreme of lord of the rings: way too much padding.

It HAS been a long time since I last tried to book however, so I think I'll try again later. See if my years of aging since the last time will make me like it. I think people just used different words back in the early 1900s, and maybe I don't like that?"
849,Fantasy,What your favorite romantic pairings in fantasy?,"This is by no means a new question, but I'm curious what other people's thoughts are. To be clear, I'm talking about romances in fantasy even if they aren't the main focus of the story. I'm also including couples that aren't necessarily ""canon"" - in that the couple never declares that they are ""together,"" but it's clear to you that there is a romantic tension between them. 

My own personal favorites:

* Jaime and Brienne (*Game of Thrones*)
* Fitz and The Fool (*Realm of the Elderlings*)
* Kaz and Inej (*Six of Crows*)
* Blue and Gansey (*The Raven Boys*)
* Achilles and Patroclus (*Song of Achilles*)

Weirdly enough, as much Brandon Sanderson, Jay Kristoff, etc. that I read, I never find the pairings particularly compelling. That being said, I still like Mia and &gt;!Ashlinn!&lt;, Vin and Elend, and Shallan and Adolin"

851,Fantasy,Best tragic fantasy?,I love deadhouse gates in malazan and absolutely loved the ending. I’m on book 4 of malazan and hoping for something to hit me hard like the end of deadhouse gates... will continue to read malazan in hopes for another DG ending but is there any fantasy series that is highly tragic and bleak but gives you hope for the characters and then just keeps ripping it away??
852,Fantasy,Books where monsters are just enablers of human cruelty?,"I'm kind of in love with this trope(?)

Basically, monsters themselves are barely more than organic robots, controlled by a single person in some way. They aren't brainwashed, they're simply just fleshy robots.

The best example would be the replica soldiers from the first F.E.A.R game.

Any suggestions?"

854,Fantasy,"Evidently I’m picky, please help anyway :D","I am looking for a fun fantasy series to read, but at the moment I have a craving for a particular type of story. I would like to read a book about a magic using protagonist that principally uses magic to solve their problems. Extra credit if the character is an adult. I know Bildungsroman is a staple of the genre, but reading about angst adolescents can get old. Even more bonus points if the mage has a cool familiar/summon ... like Haplo’s dog.

Here is a list of similar books and the things I liked, and did not like about them. Hopefully these will help tailor suggestions. 

I just read “Occultist,” which happens to be the first LitRPG novel I have ever read. I didn’t love the real world elements of it, but I have not sworn off LitRPG if it follows the right class/character. I was disappointed that the character turned into a glorified rogue, but the summoning was pretty cool.

Andrew Rowe’s series Sufficiently Advanced Magic was great. The latest book was quite disappointing because I found one of the characters to be intolerable. However, I really enjoyed the first two and I will try the fourth to see if that character has been rebalanced. 

John Bierce’s series Mage Errent is also really enjoyable. I am all caught up with it and looking forward to the next installment. 

Will Wight’s Cradle series is currently one of my most anticipated reads. I just finished Winter Steel for the second time, and so, would like to read something else.

I love Brandon Sanderson’s novels, but they do not really fight this criteria. He has hard magic systems, but the nature of the Cosmere is such that his characters tend to be more like super heroes rather than mages.

I have also read Wizard of Earth Sea, Deathgate Cycle, Dragonlance, Wheel of Time, Codex Alera, Harry Dresden, Raymond Feist, Malazan Book of the Fallen, Taran Matharu, Spellwright, and Benedict Jacka.

I’m sure there are others I have left off. That said this is the golden age of fantasy publishing. New authors and series are being published at a prodigious rate, so, I am sure, there are a myriad of stories that I have not found or even heard about. I would love any and all suggestions! Thank you in advance!"

856,Fantasy,Would like some help with my vampires.,"I'm the kind of person that likes to know the source and reasoning for strengths and weaknesses of creatures, especially vampires. So I am trying to come up with and origin story that explains their agelessness/immortality, strength, speed, senses, durability and regenerative capabilities, their weaknesses to sunlight and holy objects, why they have fangs and claws, why they have a hypnotic ability, why they are unnaturally beautiful, and why they can shift from unnaturally beautiful to something from a nightmare. I know I sound crazy, but I like to be thorough. So far I have this:

The first vampire was created using magic by a tribe somewhere in Africa near the Nile river. They wanted the ultimate predator to protect and provide for the tribe. 20 men were sacrificed to give the strength, speed, durability, and senses of 20 men and a starfish for its regenerative capabilities to one man. The magic worked but when he got hungry he couldn't keep normal food down. He would spew up this black blood looking stuff (like Jennifer from Jennifer's Body). Not knowing what to feed him, the answer came when someone started to bleed in the village. He attacked and couldn't get enough. The only way to stop him was for the person who performed the magic to use the sun and curse him with it. When the sun started to burn the vampire, it retreated into hiding.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to explain the weakness to holy objects, why the vampire would have fangs and claws, why they wouldn't age, why they would have hypnotic powers, why they would be unnaturally beautiful and why they would be able to shift from unnaturally beautiful to something nightmarish?"
857,Fantasy,Using epic fantasy tropes as religious texts in novel,"So, I'm working on an epic fantasy novel, and I've got an idea to relate epic fantasy tropes as being the main religious texts of the setting. So, think like...Bible stories and quotes, but they're based in epic fantasy tropes instead.  


So, most characters in the setting are familiar to some degree with the shapes of epic fantasy stories, character concepts and arcs, magic swords, BBEG's, etc.  


I thought it would be really interesting and humorous to then present these tropes in the story, and subvert them in different ways. Or have a character develop expectations based on these tropes, and then either deliver on these expectations with a twist, or simply deliver on them, only for the character to be suspicious of how ""tropey"" it is.  


Thoughts? Is there anything like this already?"

860,Fantasy,Best anime for Fantasy book fans?,"More often than not, when an anime fan recommends a fantasy book fan, an anime, it's an anime with a traditional fantasy MMO coat of paint. Now, these aren't necessarily bad anime, I just think what a lot of people misunderstand what most fans of fantasy books are looking for. Most high fantasy novels aren't about the traditional medieval fantasy aesthetic (in fact more unique settings that are inspired by different cultures, our are completely alien are becoming more popular), they're about exploring themes that couldn't be explored in a real-world setting, complex world-building, interesting magic systems both soft and hard, and how these factors interact (there's more of course like characters and plot, but these are more universal to all genres). So I thought I'd ask for some recommendations while also providing a few of my own.

Fullmetal Alchemist. This is one of the two anime on this list that are recommended to almost every fantasy fan, and with good reason. Alchemy is an extremely fun and interesting magic system, and the effects it has on both the plot and world are compiling. You'll be constantly introduced to new ways alchemy can be applied, some good, most horrific, and it adds to the feeling of a breathing world. And speaking of worlds, the 1930's European esk setting is a nice change of pace for both fantasy and anime. 

Attack on Titan. This is the other anime recommend to every fantasy fan, and there's also a good reason for it. Titans do what every good fantasy element strives to, and provides something that drastically changes the setting. They also work well in a combat setting, allowing for exciting, close-quarters action, and interesting military application.

Hunter X Hunter. Being my personal favorite anime, it had to find its way on here, but trust me, it belongs. It's set in a world more reminiscent of our own than Middle Earth, but that is still ripe with adventure. Nen is by far one of, if not my favorite magic system of all time, giving each character unique ways to approach combat and other situations without feeling cheap. Now there are a few holes in the world-building (I have no idea where the Hunter Association gets its funding and Heavens Arena should expose Nen to the world), but if you can get past those our find a headcanon solution, you'll have yourself one of the best fantasy stories ever.

One Piece. If you're going to watch One Piece, you are first just going to have to accept that the laws of reality just work a little differently in this world. A swordsman can derail a train with a single slash, a completely normal human can survive enough punishment to kill an elephant, and everyone either has the body of a model or a semi-truck. If you can accept that, you'll be able to get lost in a world that embodies your childhood love of pirates. The Worldbuilding is surprisingly deep, and though the magic systems are simple, they're used in fun and creative ways. If you start this show be prepared for a commitment however"
861,Fantasy,"Well-written fantasy without purple prose, cheesy names, contrived plots, etc? Is it still out there?","Genuine question. I love fantasy, haven’t read it for a few years, but all I see on returning is just turning me off from it.

I don’t mind different names as part of worldbuilding, but the overly flowery ones just sound so stupid and unbelievable most of the time. Either that, or they sound like they’re made up by the type of dimwitted Christian soccer moms  r/namenerdcirclejerk would have a field day with - can’t be Tristan or Aidan, gotta be Trystynn, Eidyn, can’t be Sara or Anna, got to be Syreesee-ella and Annisima or whatever. Like a romance novel.

They’re all living in places like the land of TierraMisterien, which is of course, full of mysteries. Every character has magic, and their powers work like superheroes’ - sparkling lasers shoot from their hands and they attract everyone they meet. Wish fullfillment crap.

Hell, things I knew were too dumb and contrived to publish *as an actual teenager* are now being allowed onto the market. It’s like all the fanfiction.net authors from 10+ years ago grew up physically, but not mentally, and started getting paid for it.

There’s a way to do it right. But most new fantasy authors seem not to get that, and I feel like I’m reading Twilight or Harry Potter fanfic done by teenage kids. I remember seeing overall smarter fantasy in the past! But now the fantasy genre is saturated with this stuff. Typically, the dumber the person and place names - hell, even the book’s title - the dumber the author, and the worse the plot and worldbuilding.

So **TL;DR:** fantasy *without* purple prose, cheesy names and bad worldbuilding, written by actually intelligent authors. Is it even published anymore?

Am I looking in the wrong places? Where do you look for the better stuff?"
862,Fantasy,"I am majorly confused. I‘ve seen ‚Art of War‘ with different authors.

So ... can anyone explain WHAT it is and HOW it should be read?",
863,Fantasy,DOTA Dragon's Blood is a great high fantasy show with one giant flaw,"For those who don't know, DOTA is an animated show based on the popular videogame called Defense of the Ancients. I just finished it so I thought I could share my thoughts

**Characters**: It follows a knight from a dragon-slaying guild, a religious military general, a mysterious sage, a disgraced princess and her companion. I found characters to be compelling and relatable and they have quite a few interesting moments. Their interactions range from endearing, to funny to even tragic. They are also faithful to their game counterparts, using abilities and spells appropriately. I wish more wacky characters appeared though. 

**World**: It is very high fantasy and it has to be since game has all kind of wizards, gods, dragons, demons as playable heroes. Worldbuilding was not the focus but what little was there was quite good. I am excited to see more. 

**Animation**: Really good. Movement is fluid during action scenes but some static scenes were kind of empty. Sound design accompanying animation made it quite impactful. 

**Art**: It is not the kind of character design I like, there is a lot of skin tight armor which makes characters look more like superheroes than knights, but I got over it. Backgrounds and creature designs were really good. CGI is used sparingly and it is hidden well, usually in the background. 

**Magic system:** As soft as it gets. It is one of those ""everyone is so powerful that they just cancel each other out"". I get not everyone likes this kind of thing (I used to hate it too) so it is important to mention. 

**Story**: Here is the big flaw I mentioned in the title. Is the story bad? No. It is actually interesting and kept me watching. Problem is the pacing. It is atrocious. Rushed to the point of getting the viewer confused. Scenes rarely get the time to breathe, characters rarely get to have a moment without quickly moving on the the next plot point/action scene. This detracts from the experience a lot so I wouldn't be surprised if half of the viewers drop it half way through. It is such a shame, being just an episode longer would completely fix this.

**Side notes**: I really liked strong female characters here, they are done right. There was more blood and gore then I expected, game is tame compared to the show. Voice acting was good but some sound mixing made it hard to hear characters in some scenes. 

Overall I give it 7/10. I am definitely excited to see more, it could turn into a real fantasy gem."

865,Fantasy,Recommend a good fantasy book with a lot of Pagan/ Celtic magic in it?,Besides Morgan Llywelyn.
866,Fantasy,"Request: Book/Series with over the top and super long battles, no moral ambiguity or complexity, absurd power levels, and fanservice","So. I have almost finished Rhythm of War by Brandon Sanderson, just a couple chapters left. It was quite good but I feel exhausted by it and the serious themes, to the point where I am starting to blatantly forget events soon after they occur and I am overall just *tired* by it, and need something... I guess I would call it Anti-RoW, as a palate cleanser. Curiously, Stormlight as a whole has a lot of things I would really want in said Anti-RoW in the more generic sense, but I would hope for different themes and overall intention in this other work.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some stuff I would hope to see:

&amp;#x200B;

* Valiant heroes. Think great warriors, huge battle commanders, mages with incredible power, forces of nature who can take on entire battalions on their own. Over-the-top is fantastic. Probably some sort of noble demon princes who are centuries old who have incredible magical talent, ancient beasts, dragons, you name it.
* Huge fights, should two armies filled with such characters meet. Think mountains having holes blown in them, swords that shoot lasers and fireballs, flying and raining destruction on each other, and hopefully such battles would be super long and super engaging.
* A total lack of moral ambiguity. Given the level of power I am describing in the heroes, presumably an antagonist would be some sort of enormous evil empire led by an immortal archmage, or a chaos god from another dimension, or something else of that sort, whose goal is clearly, blatantly, unabashedly *evil*. Their forces are not ambiguous, there are no cases wherein the heroes are forced to reckon with how horribly they've hurt innocent people, and the evil empire/chaos god/whatever's minions are clearly villainous and irredeemable, other than I guess the occasional noble defector who joins the good guys' side or some such.
* A happy ending. The good guys win and mostly all survive. The chaos lord is vanquished after a long struggle. Everyone celebrates and the main hero ends up with the beautiful warrior princess.
* A bit of fanservice. I admit, in my head I imagine said aforementioned beautiful warrior princess, or some sort of demon woman from some world where it's extremely hot or whatever, who battles in... unrealistic outfits. Maybe it's flimsily justified as, I dunno, she can form armor out of her skin or something, but let's face it, the reason is because the author wanted to write about extremely powerful and attractive female characters in revealing clothing fighting hordes of monsters or whatever.
* NO SUICIDE. I am going to repeat this one. NO SUICIDE. None. I don't want anyone to consider it, I don't want anyone to attempt it, I don't want anyone to discuss it. You might wonder why I perseverate on this so much - it's because when I asked for light and happy books a while ago, I got a recommendation that, upon my having read it, caused me to literally lose count of the number of characters who contemplated killing themselves. I'm honestly kind of frustrated that that was recommended to me, even if the book was good I hated that I had to put it down several times because it contained literally the thing I was wanting to *not* think about, repeatedly and in numerosity.
* Available in some fashion that is not through Amazon. I recognize that this limits the pool a bit, especially when it comes to self-published authors working through Kindle. This is a personal matter which I regard with importance - I will gladly pay double for a source that is not through Amazon. If you aren't  sure of the book's availability, don't worry about it and I'll take a gander myself, but if there's a book you happen to know is only available through Kindle Unlimited or some such, thank you but no thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, some people may be thinking to themselves at this point, ""Valiant heroes, no moral ambiguity, women in stupidly revealing clothing... This sounds like a terrible, immature piece of drivel that should only be read by people under the age of 15 which has no value to anyone and you should be ashamed of yourself for even asking for it."" I mean... yeah. I am asking for something that sounds like it was meant for immature teenagers, or possibly *written by* said immature teenagers. I probably should be, maybe not ashamed, but at least a little embarrassed. I am. I also don't care how immature this makes me, because this is truly honestly what I would like to read right now, and so suggestions, if you have them, would be fantastic. Thank you.

869,Fantasy,Seeking Suggestions (Epic Fantasy/High Fantasy) for a Birthday Self-Purchase,"Hello fair people of r/Fantasy,

I know there have been countless posts like this but I've never made my own. So I'm hoping you're not all totally done with them!

It is my birthday this week and I'm hoping to make a fun fantasy book purchase. I was wondering if you would be able to help me by making a couple suggestions of things to purchase.

\- I'm ideally looking for something that would fall under the high fantasy category (I love a good magic system), but also enjoy other sub-genres of fantasy  
\- I also want some killer prose in the writing (Rothfuss and Hobb make me melt with their prose)  
\- I'm open to some weirdness (love Douglas Adams and Jasper Fforde)  
\- I'm open to reading about the workings of a court/politics  
\- I am very open to reading something that doesn't have a white male protag (though not opposed to them either)  
\- Something that's underrated or less well known works for me too  
\- I would also be open to a cool hardcover/special edition of something classic (if anyone knows of any really special/wicked editions out there)  
\- I'm down with ebooks or physical copies

Some series/authors I have read and loved: Realm of the Elderlings, ASOIAF, LOTR, Gentleman Bastards, Kingkiller Chronicles, anything by Gaiman, Anne McCaffrey, Tammy Pierce."

Not the fight scenes, the BATTLE scenes, where two armies clash. I'm trying to find a fantasy book that reads in a similar vein, but is in a fantasy setting. See, with Bernard Conrwalls historical fiction I already know how the wars end, how history goes, hence I am seeking a series where I do not know the fate of the empires, kings, and armies involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will take any suggestion, but I would prefer a series or book with an audio book available on Audible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have already read: Mistborn (first 2 books), Wheel of Time (first 4 books), 16 ways to defend a walled city, name of the wind, Gotrek and Felix (first 2 books), the black company (1st book), graceling, Kingd of the wyld, and the powder mage trilogy.

873,Fantasy,The Hollow Ones by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan (mild spoilers),"*The Hollow Ones* is a new(ish) collaboration between Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan, their second after *The Strain Trilogy* from 2009. The novel follows two storylines in different eras, each dealing with young FBI agents experiencing supernatural threats. 

https://preview.redd.it/e287vo94itp61.png?width=265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb3011531704f0d5f527e5cb2ec8796b701ccb9d

The overall style feels like an attempt at a gritty *Dresden Files*. Hugo Blackwood serves in the Dresden role as the cold, apathetic, mage who investigates the supernatural. Since the majority of the story is told from either Odessa Hardwicke or Earl Solomon’s perspectives, Blackwood comes across as an asshole which, while consistent with some aspects of his character, makes him pretty unlikable. It may be my own fault for having the Dresden comparison ready to go at the start, but Blackwood lacks the goofy, flawed charm that makes Dresden likable (misogyny in the first books notwithstanding). 

Earl Solomon has to be the most interesting character in my mind, or at least the one with the best set up. As one of the first black FBI agents, he is sent to the Mississippi Delta in 1962 to investigate the lynching of a white man. I was really excited to see some of the racial threads pulled for this part of the story but most of the subplot doesn’t get into it and the best parts end up being overshadowed by the supernatural investigation. Even the lynching takes a backseat almost immediately in favor of a kid who is possessed and calling out Blackwood's name. 

That actually exposes my biggest problem with *The Hollow Ones* as a whole in my mind. In the present day with Odessa Hardwicke, the hunt for the supernatural entity behind the spree killing in the very beginning takes so much priority that subplots like the real-world implications of the event and other crimes that are related and apparently important are pushed aside if they’re even something you can remember. 

None of this is helped by Hardwicke really being the least interesting of the three main characters. There is some family history thrust into the story about three quarters in that, while relevant to the climax, wasn’t set up. It was a huge exposition dump to a question I never knew to ask. 

That’s not to say this book is all bad. The villainous entity is absolutely vile in the best way. Quick scenes expressing it’s thought process are gut wrenching and actually forced me to put the book down. The supernatural investigation vibe was phenomenal and despite all of my criticism above, the setup for future installments has my attention enough to try a second book should it ever come. Especially once you learn enough about Blackwood and his history to become sympathetic and understand the overall direction of things. Is he an asshole? Yes, absolutely. Does it make sense? Honestly, yeah. It doesn’t make me like him, but I wouldn’t call it bad characterization either. 

Ultimately, this feels like a messy bit of missed opportunity with some great promise, particularly with the talent involved. If they get a chance to continue the story, I think del Toro and Hogan can really run away with some wild and fantastical storytelling.

874,Fantasy,"Book review: The Demons Within (Grimluk, Demon Hunter #3) by Ashe Armstrong.","This third outing in Ashe Armstrong's *Grimluk, Demon Hunter* series finds Grimluk, our titular orc hunter of demons and slinger of guns, coming to the aid of a frontier town when a strange demon-like creature begins taking chunks out of the local populace. This creature, which fell from the skies above as opposed to crawling from the abyss below, starts its life on earth with barely any intelligence and an inchoate hunger. It learns and it grows, insatiable, until it finds a purpose beyond indiscriminate hunger--consuming Grimluk himself. But Grimluk is all out of bubblegum and isn't about to let anyone hurt him, or anyone else.

Armstrong's Grimluk stories are some of my favorite indie fantasy, and are unfairly slept on in my opinion. As a writer Armstrong gets stronger with each book, and the stories continue to offer an effective combination of a genuinely and invariably capital-G Good protagonist with violent action. Despite our hero's moniker, these are not grimdark books with a morass of gray morality. Now, I'll always love me a good bad boy protagonist, but something about Grimluk being a morally upright badass in a world that is often dark, violent, and scary is extremely satisfying to me. 

*The Demons Within* is a Weird Western that leans very heavily into horror. Rather than having a soundtrack from Ennio Morricone, I think that [this](https://youtu.be/XzHDvzGmmw0) is more appropriate as a theme song for the book.\*\* The setting is influenced by traditional Western motifs, in a world with magic and the gamut of traditional D&amp;D races. The book has explicit Lovecraftian influences, to the point where it's essentially part of the Cthulhu Mythos. More than that, I think *The Demons Within* would make a great horror movie, as it uses several horror movie tropes to good effect. The creature is given several point-of-view chapters, and these provide good nuance and characterization to what might otherwise just be a nameless, gross, evil Something; and while nameless/gross/evil might have worked just fine the story is stronger because we understand the antagonist's motivation and the rules that govern it.

Besides Grimluk and the demonic creature, the story is filled with secondary characters that are also well-characterized and interesting to read about. Armstrong has created a great queernorm world and I absolutely love the variety of LGBTQ characters--many of the characters are somehow queer, and their queerness is an unremarkable facet of their characters. Grimluk himself is bi, but (unless I'm very mistaken) this is more of a Word of God thing rather than something represented in the story; Grimluk has no romantic or sexual entanglements (these books are light on the T&amp;A--""tusk and ass"") and while I would recommend it for someone looking for a story with queer characters, I would hesitate to recommend it to someone looking for an explicitly queer MC.

My one criticism revolves around a secondary antagonist called the Preacher. This character is a pretty one-dimensional stock character and the parts of the story where he has a predominate on-page presence were by far the least interesting to me. I think this is exacerbated by how effectively Armstrong manages to give character and dimension to the other antagonist, a weird and inhuman blob. In comparison, the Preacher is simplistic and kind of hammy (but not in a fun or campy way), and Armstrong has done stock Western characters better before (such as the Hanging Judge in his previous book). This isn't a fatal flaw in the book, however: the other characters and the action of the story more than make up for it.

I really enjoyed this book. If you like Weird Westerns, creature-feature horror, unambiguously good protagonists and secondary characters, and extensive queer representation you should definitely pick up this book. The book doesn't revel in violence and gore, but it is an undeniable part of the story which is something to be aware of.

Armstrong is currently running [a Kickstarter to fund the next book](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ashearmstrong/by-demons-be-driven-grimluk-demon-hunter-vol-4/description) in the *Grimluk, Demon Hunter* series. The Kickstarter ends in a couple of days, and it's roughly two-thirds of the way funded. If you have the means, definitely go and pledge. (All the cool kids are doing it.)

\*\*I thought I was so clever when I thought of this the other day. However, I've had that fucking song stuck in my head on infinite repeat since then. I played myself."
875,Fantasy,Classic Jack Vance and Vancian magic,"D&amp;D style magic with wizards needing to prepare their spells in the morning is very common.  Yet that style didn't originate with Gygax et al, it's a style of magic referred to as Vancian magic, named after Jack Vance.

877,Fantasy,"2020 Bingo Retrospective, or How I Completed My First Bingo Card Ever","I did it, my fellow readers! The final version of my card is [**here**](https://imgur.com/a/mmbXsRE).

This was my second time participating in the bingo and this time I followed the advice people gave me last year and took a different approach. Instead of making a strict list and trying to stick with it, I made an exclusive bingo shelf on Goodreads and put the books that caught my interest there which gave me multiple choices for each square so I just read whatever took my fancy at any given moment. Also I found this year's card much easier than the previous one.

Initially I planned to do a complete hard mode card but I couldn't find any titles that seemed remotely interesting for some of these squares and I didn't want to force myself to read something I wasn't interested in because that would have likely ended up in a reading slump. So I gave up on that front and decided to add another challenge: Fill the card with only women authors. I'm happy to report that I achieved my goal.

Once again I read many new-to-me-authors and found new favourites. I discovered more about my preferences and kept refining my tastes. I should mention that I strictly curate my reading lists which is why I ended up enjoying most of what I read.

Thank you all for your recs and thank you our lovely mods for your hardwork, this has been a total blast!

# First Row Across

**Translated** **(H)**— [**Kalpa Imperial**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18766269) by Angélica Gorodischer **(4/5)** — A collection of stories about a fictional empire told by different storytellers. The stories are unrelated to each other, each one focused on different periods of time and people which underlines just how old and vast the empire is. I like reading historical accounts so this one worked for me, though it's certainly not for everyone.

**Snow, Ice, or Cold (H)** — [**Ice**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22677321) by Anna Kavan **(3/5)** — This one is an example of slipstream fiction and experimental new wave science fiction. A fever dream from the beginning to the end. Humanity's tendency to violence and destruction is an important theme here, though it's not really clear what's real and what's not which can be confusing at times. Worth a read if you're looking for something different.

**Optimistic** **(H)** — [**The Witch's Diary**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55738859) by Rebecca Brae **(5/5)** — Written in diary format, it follows the story of Hester, a recently graduated witch who struggles to find a decent job while having to deal with a cast of peculiar characters. It's warm, funny, and light-hearted. An uplifting read for when you're feeling down and also a great pick for October and Halloween.

**Necromancy** — [**The Death of the Necromancer**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1929938) by Martha Wells **(5/5)** — Lush prose, a loveable rogue, and an intriguing mystery. The setting is a mix of 19th century France and Victorian England. The main character is a con-man/thief who's bent on getting revenge. Necromancy here is not about raising skeletons and I liked that. It's so very different than Murderbot I wouldn't have even guessed it was written by the same author.

**Ace / Aro** **(H)** — [**The Cybernetic Tea Shop**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28421799) by Meredith Katz **(3/5**) — A slow burn romance between an AI mechanic and a sapient robot. Perfect for slice of life fans. Though I felt like something was missing, probably due to its shortness. Wish it had been a bit longer and explored the blossoming relationship in more depth.

# Second Row Across

**Ghost (H)** — [**Dusk or Dark or Dawn or Day**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31216058) by Seanan McGuire **(4/5)** — My first McGuire book. It's more about characters and atmosphere rather than action. Central theme is time and how it affects us and the world around us. It's beautifully written too, brimming with melancholia, longing, and sorrow from the very first page.

**Exploration** **(H)** — [**The Luminous Dead**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39320153) by Caitlin Starling **(4/5)** — A single setting and only two characters is a bold choice for a debut novel but it works well here. It's more like a survival story and leans toward psychological horror/thriller rather than science fiction. Atmospheric, chilling, and suspenseful all the way through. The writing seemed a bit strange at first and took me a while to ease into.

**Climate Fiction** **(H)** — [**A Children's Bible**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48647507) by Lydia Millet **(4/5)** — A group of teenagers are left to fend for themselves while their self-indulgent and degenerative parents revel in alcohol and drugs in a big mansion on their summer holiday. It's a scary depiction of apocalypse caused by the climate change and there are many Biblical allusions throughout. The prose is beautiful and poignant with a dash of humor.

**Colour in the Title** — [**Sisters of the Vast Black**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44581558) by Lina Rather **(4/5)** — Space opera with nuns in space with a giant slug-like spaceship. I'm fascinated by organic technologies so that was a plus. On the sociopolitical side of things, we have the Earth Central Governance and the Catholic Church. Religious stuff didn't bother me as I'm not really familiar with Catholicism. One thing I don't get, though, is why the Church still doesn't allow women to perform certain rituals in frigging space.

[r/fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) **Book Club** — [**The Half Killed**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25668335) by Quenby Olson **(3/5)** — Victorian era is one of my favourite settings in both visual and written media so this one should have been right up my alley but it didn't quite work for me. It's very atmospheric with lush and descriptive prose but I didn't connect with the story and the characters never quite came to life. I feel like something was missing but can't put my finger on it.

# Third Row Across

**Self-Published** — [**Moonlight, Roses &amp; Murder**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53188817) by Lorri Moulton **(2/5)** — I picked this up because 1) it was free at the time, 2) I wanted something lighter to read at night before falling asleep, 3) I love the concept of vampires and other supernatural beings blending in among humans in big cities. This one, however, ended up being a huge disappointment due to cardboard cut-out characters, cliche tropes, non-existing worldbuilding, and subpar writing.

**Chapter Epigraphs (H)** — [**The Empress of Salt and Fortune**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49882646) by Nghi Vo **(4/5)** — This one has this whimsical, fairytale vibe going on which I absolutely adore. I love the frame device and it works perfectly here. I'd love to read more about the Singing Hills Abbey but I haven't been able to get around to the sequel yet.

**Published in 2020** — [**The Glass Hotel**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52748730) by Emily St. John Mandel **(5/5)** —This one fascinated me, I was pretty much obsessed with it for a while. I love such narratives where we get glimpses into the lives of individuals and follow them as their paths cross and their lives become intertwined. I also found the writing beautiful and evocative. It's a bit tricky though because it has a realistic setting with one speculative element that doesn't play an important role in the book but I guess that'd still count.

**School or University** **(H)** — [**A Wizard of Earthsea**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10457185) by Ursula K. Le Guin **(4/5)** — I’m ashamed to admit that this was my first Le Guin book but it’s better late than never, right? Earthsea had been in the back of my mind ever since my uni days and I wish I had read it back then. Can’t wait to read the rest now.

**Book About Books** — [**The Thirteenth Tale**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6986999) by Diane Setterfield **(5/5)** — This is ultimately a love letter to books, readers, and authors. Miss Winter’s story mesmerized me and broke my heart all at once and I couldn't stop thinking about it for days after I finished the book. Setterfield definitely has a way with words, the prose is lovely and there are some gorgeous turns of phrases and passages throughout. This one also has a realistic setting with one ambigous speculative element that I'm not sure what to think of.

# Fourth Row Across

**Made You Laugh (H)**  — [**Redemption In Indigo**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17448380) by Karen Lord **(4/5)** — It’s based on an African folktale and reads like a folktale itself, like it's being told by a storyteller under a tree in a lazy afternoon. It was adorable and I loved the storyteller's humour.

**Short Stories** **(H)** — [**Things We Lost in the Fire**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36684448) by Mariana Enríquez **(5/5)** — In this collection of 12 stories, Enríquez tells us a country's reality through ghosts, invisible men, and haunted houses. Remove the fantastical and we come face to face with Argentina's dark past and the ongoing effects of the past mistakes. This was a difficult read for me because it hit too close to home. Most of what I read here is similar to what happened in my own country's history. I urge readers who dismiss magical realism as “just fantasy masquerading as serious literature"" to read this book and think again.

**Big Dumb Object (H)** — [**The Stars Are Legion**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28955230) by Kameron Hurley **(5/5)** — I read other space operas before and after this one but I believe this was the book that seriously sparked my interest in the genre. Here we have a unique setting, well- rounded characters, and lots of exploration. I loved Zan, her whole journey was like a fever dream. This book also made me realized that I find the organic technologies fascinating. Fair warning though, there are some gross stuff happening which may be disturbing for some readers.

**Feminist** — [**Travel Light**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16565388) by Naomi Mitchison **(4/5)** — I'd been meaning to read this book ever since *I read This Is How You Lose the Time War*. It read like a fairy tale and evoked in me a similar sense of wonder, whimsy, and adventure like Middle Earth books and A Wizard of Earthsea did. The writing was elaborate, at times confusing, but overall beautiful. I suppose it’s not feminist in the sense we understand today, but an independent young girl travelling on her own instead of marrying and settling down must have been a big deal in 1952, right?

**Canadian Author** — [**Mexican Gothic**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53117768) by Silvia Moreno-Garcia **(5/5)** — I'm a huge fan of gothic and this was deliciously gothic. It was atmospheric and at times quite disturbing. We have some loaded subjects under scrutiny here such as colonialism, eugenics, sexism. It's all crafted so tastefully nothing comes off as heavy-handed. Also mad props to Moreno-Garcia for all those goodies she’s offered us on Goodreads. Her writing on the history of mining and colonialism in Mexico were particularly enlightening.

# Fifth Row Across

**Number in the Title** — [**Harrow the Ninth**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49236764) by Tamsyn Muir **(4/5)** — Such a mindfuck, pardon my language. I love how Muir doesn't give a damn about genre conventions and just writes what she wants to write because it takes some serious guts to switch gears like this in the middle of a trilogy. I have some small nitpicks with this book but for the most part it worked for me. Can't wait for the third book.

**Romance** — [**In the Vanishers' Palace**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41729893) by Aliette de Bodard **(3/5)** — A Beauty and the Beast retelling with a sapphic romance at its heart which is totally my jam but I feel like characters could have used a bit more polishing. They barely interacted throughout the story which made the romance part kinda fell flat. The author certainly has a fruitful imagination though and I find her settings brilliant.

**Magical Pet** **(H)** — [**Minor Mage**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56043372) by T. Kingfisher **(4/5)** — This was a charming that would be suitable for middle grade. Things get pretty dark at times but the overall tone humorous and light-hearted, and there is kindness, empathy and hope to be found. I adored that snarky armadillo.

**Graphic Novel** **(H)** — [**Through the Woods**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20736510) by Emily Carroll **(2/5)** — This one didn't work for me. It's creepy yes, but not in a substantive or memorable way. Artwork and colours are good, but the stories end abruptly in the vaguest way possible and the writing is without charm. I seem to be in the minority here though, so your mileage may vary.

**Politics** **(H)** — [**Ancillary Justice**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333789) by Ann Leckie **(5/5)** — I wish I'd picked this up sooner because it was exactly what I wanted. I loved the setting and the scope, I loved Breq and the side characters. Also, now that I read this one I can totally see its influence on Martha Wells and her *Murderbot* which is also among my favourites."
878,Fantasy,Which fantasy books have psychopathic/sociopathic assassins who have POV chapters or are protagonists?,"I want to read something where the character (preferably an assassin) performs his tasks completely focused on the job and not at all perturbed by the grisly nature of their actions.

880,Fantasy,"Wagwan, badmen and bad girls! Diana Wynne Jones raw af wasn't she?","I just reread The Homeward Bounders. Love Diana due to her simple yet effective style. No long, languid, purple prose. She's not out here writing complex sentences for the sake of it.

881,Fantasy,Female POV Romantic Fantasy that's adult or higher-level YA?,"I want a romance book that isn't just a love story. The romance should obviously be an incredibly significant part of the plot, but it shouldn't be the main plot like, say, **Kushiel's Dart** and its sequels. YA is fine too as long as its on the mature side i.e., there's no holding back on the gore and other generally ""tougher"" themes. Positive examples are **The Cruel Prince** and **The Bridge Kingdom**. 

Super important requirements:

1. Female POV (If she's part of a larger cast of POVs, it's still  super welcome)

2. No Urban Fantasy or Futuristic Dystopian settings. I like it when the setting is not the modern world or any futuristic ones, for that matter. I also dislike reading modern slang and recently coined words, but I guess that's taken care of by not having the setting in the present.

That's basically it. Magic is a plus but having it as a requirement might dwindle down my choices."
882,Fantasy,Review: Of Blood and Steel by Seymour Zeynalli,"Of Blood and Steel by Seymour Zeynalli is an easy to read, adventure story that I was happy to turn to whenever I had free time. It follows the adventures of a young woman who is trying to get herself and a baby safely through rough terrain and the hardened old assassin that she hired to escort them. I thoroughly enjoyed that traditional fantasy feel of these people going on a long journey and facing interesting new threats and creatures and situations along the way. And as they go on, they also discover more about each other and about themselves. There's a great story here, hints of great world-building, and clearly a lot of storytelling potential by this new author. I'm going to be keeping an eye on his later works, because I think with a bit more experience he's going to soon be telling some exceptional stories. 

I mentioned that this has that traditional fantasy adventure feel that I enjoyed. I must also mention that the author set out to bring the unique flavour of the culture of the Caucasus region to his world-building and I really enjoyed all the little tidbits of this in the descriptions and world-building. And it wasn't just descriptions of food here and there, which some other reviewers have mentioned, I got a good sense of the culture through the characters' conversations and perspectives about war and life and what they had been through in the past and so on. Again, with a bit more experience, I think the author could become an exceptional world-builder and could tell some really unique stories from this influence. 

I think the thing I most missed in this story is seeing the thoughts and feelings of the characters portrayed more deeply or focused on more, which would have taken the story from good and interesting to exceptional. There was a bit too much focus on the mechanics of where everyone was going and what they were doing and less focus on their thoughts and feelings as they did this. 

The fantastic elements were slowly revealed throughout the story with more creatures and more magic in the later half of the book. But the revelation I was most satisfied with was a character revelation that really tied up the story for me and gave it a satisfying conclusion. 

Finally, I want to mention that there were quite a few swear-words, mostly f-words, peppered throughout the story which felt like they had been placed there just to make sure the story would get classified as ""adult"" - which it was, I just think it's sad that we're at a point in general where authors feel they need to include swearwords in order to get that adult classification. It's an adult story because it deals with adult themes like war and survival and revenge and so on, and in my opinion doesn't need the swear words to prove that. 

Overall, I would recommend this book to lovers of fantasy adventure stories. I've discovered over the past few months that I have little patience for a lot of big name traditionally published stories that have perfectly polished prose and get all kinds of hype. The only books that have been able to hold my interest lately have all been self-published or indie/small-press books that capture that sense of adventure I'm looking for in fantasy much better. "
883,Fantasy,"Composite Creatures by Caroline Hardaker - filled with loneliness, isolation, creeping sadness, and a silent, fragile horror. Review!"," Originally posted on my blog, [Black Forest Basilisks](https://blackforestbasilisks.home.blog/). 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What I wanted all along was to bury myself deep where it’s warm and never come out. I won, they didn’t.

Melancholy and compelling, Caroline Hardaker has captured the narrow wistfulness of self-inflicted isolation. As we draw ourselves away from the world, tuck ourselves into the warmth of our four encroaching walls, it becomes harder and harder to connect with anything and anyone that exists outside ourselves. We chain our doors, check the locks, and keep ourselves in as much as we keep others out. While this is not a book about pandemics, or plagues, or even about quarantines, it nevertheless manages to invoke a sense of catharsis in relation to current events.

Hardaker takes us to a future where the apocalypse never fully arrived. Humanity mostly kept up, albeit with sacrifices. Small details reveal the cracks: natural animals are largely extinct, the sky is lilac with pollution. People die young if they lack the funds to pay for healthcare. Yet, these facts are presented in a manner that is nonchalant, normalized. It’s not about the world at large; instead, it’s about Norah’s tiny, internal universe. It’s about her thoughts, her fears, and her own inability to connect.

Easton Grove matches Art and Norah together based on genetic compatibility. Together, they’ll share the key to longevity: a small bundle of silky grey fur who they name Nut. Even as Norah’s ability to reach out to her old friends degrades, she finds solace in Nut’s deep blue eyes and unconditional love. Her peaked, translucent ears, the way she curls up on the couch in Norah’s lap, her tiny little paws – to Norah, that’s what love is.

Certainly, she loves Art too. At least, she tells herself she does. They find a rhythm together, cohabiting but rarely connecting in meaningful ways. When Art proposes, Norah knows she should be excited, ready to shout it out to the world. Instead, she finds herself hiding the engagement ring as though it’s shameful. It’s a piece of herself that she doesn’t yet recognize as “her,” maybe even a piece of herself that doesn’t belong.

As Norah descends deeper and deeper into the internal passageways of her own soul, she grows further estranged from Art. They both try to bridge the gap in their own ways with Christmas gifts or dinners at special places, but Art finds himself seeking absolution in his writing. When he looks at Nut, he is certain he hears his own voice echoing back at him until he can hardly tell where he ends and Nut begins.

The author’s past experience as a poet shines through in her lush, intimate prose. This is a book made up of emotions. It is a peek inside a soul, told honestly and authentically. There is neither action nor adventure, but there is loneliness, isolation, creeping sadness, and a silent, fragile horror. From the first page, Norah’s thoughts had me captured. During 2020, my own world compressed to four walls and a pit in my stomach that kept me from connecting with others even when I knew it would be best to reach out. Norah, however, finds herself caught in a different sort of trap that is of her own making.

Norah’s world compresses down as she avoids her friends’ calls and texts. She becomes avoidant on every front, pouring all of her energy into Nut. Even when she does go out for drinks or speaks on the phone with the people she used to care for, she finds she has nothing to say. The patterns they used to exist in were destroyed the day she joined Easton Grove’s ovum organi program. The day she and Art met brought Nut out from her box.

Norah’s struggles feel incredibly honest. She is a deeply flawed person; most of her unhappiness is brought on by her own choices. Yet, it’s hard to imagine any other path for her. She builds up walls out of a desire for self preservation. A cozy, metaphorical den where she can curl up into a ball. Just her – and Nut. Though, really, is there a difference between the two? In Norah’s mind, Nut often seems to be an extension of her own identity rather than a truly separate being.

She’s driven to care for and protect Nut. Yet, when push comes to shove and it’s time for Nut to be cracked open… she falls back into herself once more. Fundamentally, Norah will do whatever she must to protect the idea of her own goodness, her own rightness. She’s wrapped herself up too tightly and committed too deeply to the path she’s on to change course. And if that means sacrificing her own morality, twisting it into an unrecognizable mass of excuses and justifications, then perhaps that’s the path she’ll have to take.

Many thanks to Angry Robot for providing this review copy. *Composite Creatures* will be released on April 13th.

884,Fantasy,The Poppy War Trilogy,So I'm not here to spoiler the ending but I'll say the ending was quite open so has the author R.F. Kuang made any statement if there is some follow up series?

This quote made me think about creative ""prices for power"". They can be societal like in 40k and Dragon Age where mages are considered walking time bombs, and often shunned by society only allowed to exist under specific conditions. They can also be personal like in Powder Mage where gunpowder gives mages power, but also causes addiction (magic cocaine basically). 

So what is your favorite ""price""?"

Hard Mode: Magical Pet, Politics,

5/5 Stars

&gt;***I had a sister, once…***  
&gt;  
&gt;In a world ruled by fierce warrior queens, a grand empire was built upon the backs of Phoenix Riders—legendary heroes who soared through the sky on wings of fire—until a war between two sisters ripped it all apart.  
&gt;  
&gt;***I promised her the throne would not come between us.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Sixteen years later, Veronyka is a war orphan who dreams of becoming a Phoenix Rider from the stories of old. After a shocking betrayal from her controlling sister, Veronyka strikes out alone to find the Riders—even if that means disguising herself as a boy to join their ranks.  
&gt;  
&gt;***But it is a fact of life that one must kill or be killed. Rule or be ruled.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Just as Veronyka finally feels like she belongs, her sister turns up and reveals a tangled web of lies between them that will change everything. And meanwhile, the new empire has learned of the Riders’ return and intends to destroy them once and for all.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Sometimes the title of queen is given. Sometimes it must be taken.***

YA is hit or miss for most people, and the genre itself is filled with a lot of duds. But this was not one of them. It does follow a very typical YA storyline - girl wants to better herself/join the rebellion, disguises herself as a boy, falls in love, etc. - but this is a great edition to the world of YA Fantasy. The two sisters - Veronyka and Val - have the most interesting relationship. It's abusive and loving and desperate. The other two narrators - Tristan and Sev - are unique. Tristan is supposed to be the brave phoenix rider, but he has a lot of issues he needs to work through. Sev is the foot soldier on the other side who realizes that he isn't fighting for good. All three characters have some great development and I cannot wait to finish this series. I loved the fight scenes and the world - it was rich and felt realistic. And phoneixes!

It isn't perfect. The twist at the end took me by surprise because I still don't get it, but I hope that it'll be cleared up in the next book. Parts were unbelievable. But it was fun and I really enjoyed it.

# [Descendant of the Crane by Joan He](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41219451-descendant-of-the-crane)

Other Bingo Square: Politics

2.5/5 Stars

&gt;Princess Hesina of Yan has always been eager to shirk the responsibilities of the crown, but when her beloved father is murdered, she’s thrust into power, suddenly the queen of an unstable kingdom. Determined to find her father’s killer, Hesina does something desperate: she engages the aid of a soothsayer—a treasonous act, punishable by death... because in Yan, magic was outlawed centuries ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;Using the information illicitly provided by the sooth, and uncertain if she can trust even her family, Hesina turns to Akira—a brilliant investigator who’s also a convicted criminal with secrets of his own. With the future of her kingdom at stake, can Hesina find justice for her father? Or will the cost be too high?  
&gt;  
&gt;In this shimmering Chinese-inspired fantasy, debut author Joan He introduces a determined and vulnerable young heroine struggling to do right in a world brimming with deception.

I honestly can't say how good this book was because my expectations were so off. Based on the cover and the blurb, I totally thought this would have a lot more fantasy elements - at least give me a giant crane like the cover says! Instead this book was all politics.

Honestly, it wasn't horrible. Some of the choices were weird and I never really knew what was going on (as in, I thought the MC's brother died at one point but it was someone else entirely). The ending felt very left field. I went in &gt;!knowing that this was a standalone, but it feels like the cliffhanger for a series. !&lt;

# [The Once and Future Witches by Alix E. Harrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49504061-the-once-and-future-witches)

Other Bingo Squares: Pub 2020, Feminist

5/5 Stars

&gt;In 1893, there's no such thing as witches. There used to be, in the wild, dark days before the burnings began, but now witching is nothing but tidy charms and nursery rhymes. If the modern woman wants any measure of power, she must find it at the ballot box.  
&gt;  
&gt;But when the Eastwood sisters--James Juniper, Agnes Amaranth, and Beatrice Belladonna--join the suffragists of New Salem, they begin to pursue the forgotten words and ways that might turn the women's movement into the witch's movement. Stalked by shadows and sickness, hunted by forces who will not suffer a witch to vote-and perhaps not even to live-the sisters will need to delve into the oldest magics, draw new alliances, and heal the bond between them if they want to survive.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's no such thing as witches. But there will be.

Fuck this was a great book. Harrow’s prose is beautiful, the characters are well developed, the story is complex and multilayered. This is a book that speaks to not only women’s power, but the power of the marginalized. The words, the way, and the will. Just wonderful. A favorite of the year, that’s for sure. 

**VERDICT**

The Once and Future Witches, 100%. Crown of Feathers if you are into something less complex and more fun. Descendant of the Crane if you like politics I guess?

888,Fantasy,A Guide to WebFiction (Part 2),"A while (\*cough\* a year \*cough\*) ago, I made a [guide to webfiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/en7mmw/a_guide_to_webnovels/). People showed a lot of interest in it and were very positive towards the medium in general, which was awesome! Meanwhile, some exciting things have happened in the community that can help both readers and writers, so I thought I'd write a bit of a follow up to it. If you haven't read the first guide, I recommend you do so, as all of the basic info is there and, unless you already know a fair bit about what webfiction is, this won't make a whole lot of sense to you, otherwise.

Up to date? Let's move on, then!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A few disclaimers first:   
&gt;  
&gt;1) Same as for the first guide: I'm a webfiction writer and you'll find me in some of the places I've mentioned before and am about to mention now. That's now why I write these guides. I genuinely love the idea of webfiction because a) it's the modern equivalent of 19th century serialized fiction and that's just cool as heck and b) it's a very good way to provide authors with income while allowing them to keep their series up for free for those who can't afford to pay for them, thus providing entertainment for those who might need it the most. It's a medium that hits both my personal tastes and values and I'd love to bring more people into it.   
&gt;  
&gt;2) My focus has and will continue to be less known webseries that fall outside the ""usual"" genres (LitRPG, Isekai, Xianxia and Wuxia, etc). If you want to find those, you generally just have to go anywhere that publishes webfiction and you'll find them. In fact, I suggest you join [r/noveltranslations](https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/)! But I assume a lot of writers here will want something closer to traditionally published books, just in a new format, and I'd like to help them find that, as well as help the authors that don't get as much traction in the medium because they're not doing what's popular.

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost: [TopWebFiction](http://topwebfiction.com/) is accepting new writers again! What that means for readers is that you might see some new faces and series there, especially on [New Listings](http://topwebfiction.com/?ranking=new). What it means for readers is that you can sign up to list yours. You'll need an invite from a writer with an account, but that's not hard to get if you're active in the community at all.

Second is a new growing community, also for both readers and writers. It's called Archdale and the [website](https://virtualbookshelf.home.blog/) is heaven on earth for anyone looking to get into webfiction. BookKeeper has catalogued dozens of series from multiple platforms, tagged them, scored them, marked which ones are completed or on-going, and basically done everything else you can imagine to make your life easier. Best part? New ones are still being added constantly. Their [discord](https://discord.com/invite/QQSpcmu) is a nifty little place with contests and events where you can gain points and trade them for editing and publishing services. They also have a [twitter](https://twitter.com/archdalebooks) where you can keep up to date with new review releases and discord activities. Whether you're a writer looking for a community to join or a reader in need of a directory where you can search for your next perfect series, this might just be the place for you.

Speaking of twitter, I'm saddened to say that there aren't many accounts dedicated to webfiction on the blue bird site. There're the [RoyalRoad](https://twitter.com/royalroadl) and [Tapas](https://twitter.com/tapas_app) and [WattPad](https://twitter.com/wattpad) official accounts, of course, but not many that focus on particular genres to help parse things down, like there are with books, for example. [LGBTQ+ WebSerials](https://twitter.com/lgbtqwebserials) focuses solely on series with LGBTQ+ representation, but that's pretty much all I've found. If anyone knows about anything else, let me know!

Which leads me to the last point of this guide: for part 3 of this webfiction guides series, I would like to round up a few less known webseries in the fantasy genre, but excluding the popular tags mentioned above, both picked by me and proposed by the community. But the more I thought about this, the more I realized I might as well just create a directory + SNS fully dedicated to this. Is that something you guys would be interested in? Let me know what you think!"

IMO Dragonbone Chair was fine, but not great, what should I expecting the next 2?","Not sure how to describe book one, because a lot happened as I look back on it, but while reading it there didn’t seem to be much going on... should I dive in for the next ones?"
890,Fantasy,What books have been on your TBR pile the longest and why.,"As we approach the new Bingo season, I've been looking at the books on my shelves that I've still to read, and wondering whether they are going to be suitable to the as yet unknown squares.

I have a couple that have been with me a very long time.

* **The White Dragon** by Anne McCaffrey. I read the first two of the books back in the mid-70's and immediately bought the third one. Yes I've had it that long. Other books came along that grasped my attention, so it just got left on the shelf all this time.
* **Little Big** by John Crowley. I've had this one for decades as well. I read a couple other Crowley books back in the early 90's and the second one (The Deep) just left me with a meh feeling so I just moved on to other authors. It was his first novel, so perhaps that shouldn't have put me off.

What books do you have that have been lingering on your TBR pile the longest (either physically or digitally) and what's been preventing you from getting to them?"
891,Fantasy,"The history, pop culture and fantastical folklore that influenced the original Godzilla",
892,Fantasy,Review: When the Tiger Came Down the Mountain by Nghi Vo,"So, [When the Tiger Came Down the Mountain](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53265678-when-the-tiger-came-down-the-mountain) is part of a series starting with [The Empress of Salt and Fortune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51190882-the-empress-of-salt-and-fortune), but the two books tell completely different and individual standalone stories (that share a main character), thus one could read them in any order, or read only one of the novellas.

Last year I read The Empress of Salt and Fortune, which although I appreciated I didn't like particularly. It had various parts I enjoyed, but as a whole it didn't really work for me (and I fully get than I'm in the minority here). I've written about it [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ijuvzb/copying_mount_readmore_reading_our_2020_top/), in case anyone want's to see what my problems with the book were.

All these said, it was very clear to me that Nghi Vo is a talented writer, and the setting she created is pretty interesting, so I decided to give this one a go. Thankfully I dig this one a lot.

In first glance it's pretty similar to The Empress of Salt and Fortune, with its ""story within a story nature"", and the somber, grounded tone. But this one feels significantly more fleshed out (both character and world wise), it feels less like a synopsis, more like a story ""properly"" told than hinted at.

It has some really excellent, subtle humor than I didn't found in the first book. Plus mammoths, awesome, fluffy, charming mammoths. It also uses the framing format with far greater and interesting results, since here we both have a (kinda meta) commentary on the ""true versions"" of stories, and some (significantly lacking from the first book) tension in both story fronts.

Negatives? Well the pacing does, needlessly, slow down for a bit near the 2/3rds of the story (but it's a short novella, so that shouldn't be ma big problem for anyone), and the power dynamics in the romance of the story are, in my opinion, pretty fucked-up (quite possible that this is a 100% subjective problem).

I'd really recommend it to anyone who either enjoyed The Empress of Salt and Fortune, or found it promising, but not really their thing. Oh, and to people who like mammoths too. Definitely to people who like mammoths.

When I finished The Empress of Salt and Fortune I wasn't sure if I'd read this one, now having just finished When the Tiger Came Down the Mountain I really hope that Nghi Vo will give us more Singing Hill stories. In my opinion it's a really big improvement over the first book."
893,Fantasy,"The connection between ""sub-creation"" in fantasy and the use of languages","Hello everyone! I was inspired to write this post after seeing specific similarities between the Ainulindalë section in the Silmarillion and a particular chapter in the ""The Magician's Nephew"". I am currently reading the sixth installment of the Chronicles of Narnia series and coming to the point where the founding of Narnia is described, it is clear that C.S. Lewis shared a similar depiction of his fictional world with the one used by J.R.R. Tolkien for the creation of Arda.   

  
 Through the musical medium, both worlds come into being as the primordial song of creation progresses and changes. In the Silmarillion, Arda grows and is fashioned as the conscious thoughts of the Ainur materialize in front of them though melodies and vibrations, adding to the vision set before them by the theme declared by Eru Ilúvatar; in the Chronicles of Narnia, very similarly, the universe is created and shaped by Aslan's song and one element that I find particular important in both works is the fact that, though the first theme is always placed by a divine creator, the music only develops and continues with the alterations provided by sub-creators such as the Ainur or the rest of the creatures waken up by Aslan. They are actively part of the growing process.   

  
 The concept of using music is deeply linked with the importance that languages have for Tolkien. We know that he referred to his world building and implementation of myths as ""sub-creation"" and one of the most important components of that is creating powerful stories and characters that can guide the reader into a new world. That also applies to languages cause as he said in his essay ""On Fairy-Stories"", ""to ask what is the origin of stories…is to ask what is the origin of language and of the mind"". You can't have languages without people and a culture behind them. I would think most of these ideas were shared by C.S. Lewis seeing that they were friends and part of the same literary group. 

  
 I find the idea of fantasy as a genre (the part of it that relates mostly with the creation of entirely or partially new worlds) and language incredibly relevant but besides the two writers that I mentioned I don't know of anyone who tried to link the two concepts as heavily as they did. I haven't read as many fantasy books as most of the people in this sub, so maybe you guys know more about it, what do you think?"

899,Fantasy,Fantasy in the format of in-world memoirs,"So this strange idea have popped into my brain for some reason, and I would like to hear opinions on it, as well as getting recommendations if there is an author that have already done this.

The idea is fairly simple, instead of a traditional narrative the story would be told as the life story of a single character, who of course will be an unreliable narator, as he/she would have a vested interest in making themselves look good. I imagine that this would function better with multiple ""memoirs"" from different interconnected characters, to highlight inconsistansies.

What would you think of fantasy in this format. Do you think it could work, and if so what do you think it would require to make the story work? And knowing the premise, would you actually be interested in reading such a story?

I am not a writer myself, I'm just curious if this strange idea could function in any way. I am doubtful of this, but not putting the idea out there would seem a waste to me, if there is someone that could do something with it.

Of course somebody might already have done so, and if that is the case, please direct me towards their work."
900,Fantasy,Vlad Dracula III," 

My background goes further back than what is known, so I’ll give you a summary of it.  
When I and my twin brother Harth Radu Washington, were young around 12-13 years old during 4000 BC a woman caught us fighting each other and scolded us for not working together and being against each other, in response we threw rocks at her and beat her with sticks when we’d finished she yelled, “You two are disrespectful insects, your very existence annoys me, I tried to be nice yet you both attack me proving that the children of Adam shouldn’t exist, I curse you both to eternal reincarnation, to be forever related, unless you both can unite the entirety of existence, together, and no matter how many reincarnations, you will remember everything and will never get used to the physical and emotional pain that will inevitably be inflicted upon you two”.  
She left and we laughed at her, not believing a word she said, so we went on with our life eventually dying, being reincarnated as twins again.  
This continued as we were always brothers or cousins until I found a solution to stop our reincarnation around 1440 AD, The solution was to become immortal so that we could learn how to stop the curse. I became cruel during this time. Which led to a disagreement between me and my brother, so we went to war.  
I had my people go throughout the land gathering many vampiric beings, I drained their blood into a large wine barrel, as our war became worse and he began winning, I drank all of the blood, I died that day, but woke up back in my body shocked, I then retreated and was captured, eventually escaping that horrid fate.

I was now effectively a God, I then went around hunting other vampiric beings draining them of their blood, adding their curses to my own.  
Then it happened, during the plague, I had gotten desperate for any sort of healthy blood so I fed on snakes, I unknowingly created a new variation of vampiric snake, in which there are three variations of them, the Snake headed Gorgons who’ve existed for a long time, before the ones born from the plague these vampiric snakes were larger stronger, faster, and much more intelligent than regular snakes, and with each new generation, new mutations began appearing as well.  


The snakes could somehow alter the DNA of humans, it was probably a mutation caused when the snakes bit a plague-infected human which somehow altered both, the snakes began laying bigger eggs, the babies grew arms, and as each generation of snake passed, They got smarter and eventually became very effective with their arms.  
The humans also began looking different, children grew faster as well, Morphing into legless vampiric humanoid snakes, They were driven into the large forest and deep into caves that kept them hidden together, they only came out to hunt, feeding on animals and humans alike,   
as they retreated underground, so did I and many other vampires hoping the plague would end.

Somethings that are myths are Vampires and reflective surfaces, the truth is we don’t reflect on things containing silver, and sunlight only kills a few versions of vampires while others use the sunlight to become stronger than what they normally are, Their biggest downfall is glowing in the dark and the idiotic rumor of garlic... which originated through rabies infected humans, as well as vampires infected with that virus.  
We do have a huge rivalry with most were-entities though. With that being said you’re all caught up with my past.

I almost forgot to mention that I met the witch again, she said, “I was young and furious when I cursed both of you, I will change your curse, all you need to do is apologize to us and you’ll be free”. I smiled at her but shook my head no explaining, “Yes I will apologize but I don’t want you to get rid of the curse, I’ve lived for so long I actually want to unite the world now, protect it from others who might want to harm it”

It turned out that the witch was the first woman Lilith whose story is nothing short of amazing and I’ve also met many different entities such as the three Gods of Nightmara/Nightmaria Korak father of Garok, and Kitara Daughter of Garok. The son of the Grim Reaper named Mati. Lucifer, and Jesus Christ himself.   
I’ve also been to many different realms such as Crania, which to my understanding is a realm in which everything created whether written down, thought of, etc exists such as copies of myself, Lucifer, Hosanna, Death, Gods, Goddesses, and more. They are weaker than the real thing and unless their stories are concluded, Cannot leave the story of which they reside.

This is an excerpt from Quiet, Please by James Branch Cabell. For context Cabell is talking about how his preferred style of writing, belles lettres, has gone out of fashion and been replaced. It is dated in the terms it uses (as it was written in 1952), but I believe it is extremely relevant in terms of ideas and how much the world came to resemble his ideas. Please give this a read and share what you think of it. Thank You!"

915,Fantasy,Review: Watching by Winston Rowntree,"&gt;We are all watching at one point or another  
&gt;  
&gt;And the reasons are many  
&gt;  
&gt;But they are really only one  
&gt;  
&gt;We watch to understand

*Watching* is a comic by Winston Rowntree, available [for free](http://www.viruscomix.com/page585.html) on his website or through major retailers as a physical book. In the far future, most human hardships have been eliminated. Free of death and illness, people have turned to time travel to fill their endless days. They can't interact with the past, only observe it. The main character, while exploring a primitive 21st century hospital, finds a young woman dying of a genetic disorder, and becomes obsessed with watching her.

At its heart, this is a story about the way we separate ourselves from what frightens us. Pain, infirmity, loss--all are things we try not to think about until life forces them on us. People will destroy their lives to avoid feeling the emotions that most scare them. At the same time, we're drawn to other people's horrors. We read stories about war, famine, and slavery from a safe remove. Often we reduce the people who go through those things to objects of suffering, because granting them their full humanity would mean admitting we share a reality.

In *Watching*, our present is the subject of someone else's morbid curiosity. The dying woman is as far removed from the nameless narrator's experience as photos of starving children are from most of ours. He doesn't understand her, and he doesn't understand why he can't stop watching her. But with simple language and muted art, Rowntree teases out the character's complex emotions. He doesn't offer reassuring platitudes, but challenges us to accept the things we are afraid of into our reality, and in so doing accept not only the complex humanity of those we pity, but the parts of ourselves we shy away from.

The comic is short--only 80 pages in book form. The hour or so it takes to to read it is well worth it."

918,Fantasy,Para's Proper Reviews: The Unbroken by C.L. Clark,"*ARC received from the publisher (Orbit) in exchange for an honest review.*

This has been, hands down, one of my most anticipated releases of the year. I’ve been looking for books with messy, complicated relationships lately, so that sounded fantastic, plus being promised critique of colonialism on top and that cover? With *those arms*? 😍

Unfortunately, while it’s a good book, I have to admit I found it something of a struggle, even if it was no fault of its own.

Touraine has been stolen as a child and indoctrinated to be a soldier for the empire of Balladaire. After a few years of service, her company gets sent to her homeland to help supress a rebellion. Luca is Balladaire’s legitimate heir, who goes to Qazāl to deal with the rebellion and prove herself capable of ruling to get her uncle off the throne. Along the way, the two women get hopelessly entangled, both in politics and with each other.

The main star of the book are absolutely the themes. The way it examines colonialism from both sides of the coin and uses it to craft the story is masterful. The way Touraine is loyal to the empire that mistreats her and very slowly and gradually starts to reconsider things and fight for her own place in the world. The way Luca tries to be a better ruler but makes horrible choices anyway. The question of improving the system or tearing it down. Often, fiction offers easy answers, but this did not. It felt very real. I also liked that the colonial power was France-inspired instead of England as is more typical.

The relationship developing between them is equally messy. Clark is not afraid to explore the uneven power dynamic in all its complexity and potential for conflict. It was absolutely my favourite aspect because I simply haven’t seen many fictional books like it before.

It also deals prominently with religion, which is directly tied to magic, and I found the approach extremely fascinating – Balladaire has no magic and renounced all worship of gods, claiming it to be to be uncivilised superstition. Yet the thing Luca is most curious about is whether there is any truth in the stories of Qazāli healing magic, which could help save her homeland.

So after all this praise, how come that I struggled with it? Honestly, I’m not completely sure myself. If there is a flaw I could see, it’s that the pacing is a little uneven in places, not nearly to the extent it’d bother me *this* much. I think my main problem was the tension – it’s unpredictable and very intense, with characters making a lot of choices that make you want to yell “WHY are you DOING this” at them, and while this is a feature for most people, I was apparently in the mood for something more chill and fluffy, something I didn’t realise until I was a good way through.

If you want an intense book and the premise sounds good to you, I would absolutely still recommend it. And I am definitely interested in the sequel – I just hope that with the next one, the timing will be better.

That said, I’m calling on the r/fantasy members to help me out with recommendations.

Books I’ve loved: 
- pretty much anything from Brandon Sanderson (I’ve read all but his some of his short stories)
- The dresden files
-The Lightbringer series
-Riyria Revelations
-The night angel’s trilogy
-the warded man books

925,Fantasy,"What is the point of setting your story in South East Asian fantasy world, if your characters sound like modern Americans?","Raya seems to be another example of an annoying trope in fantasy I see constantly, due to overbearing American influence on pop culture. Which is no matter how different the setting and how inspired it is, the characters speak like modern Americans, and for me, that destroys my enjoyment of it, cause I just can't lose myself in this universe when people talk the same as in a sitcom. 

Why this is even more annoying about Raya is, that Disney made huge deal out of how its influenced by South East Asian mythology and how how actors are properly chosen. I was looking forward to actually watching a Disney movie for once, but I couldn't after I saw the trailers and posters(it just felt like Disney re-skiing a new folk lore). In the end I watched a few reviews, but Honest Trailers really accentuated this problem with dialogue, but I will come back to that. 

So I can't say much about the representation of the mythology, but the actors are East Asian, which is like casting Canadians to portray Hispanic Middle Americas. The other problem comes through the dialogue, cause to me the characters talk like Americans(Californians mostly...) so in the end, for most of audience it ends up being just another American movie(let's be real most people aren't gonna research the casting of a Disney animated movie). And in the end, I am left wondering, what is the point of representation, if I feel like I am watching another generic American product (I am Eastern European). I would really not like Hollywood/Disney to do this to Eastern Europe... *cough*Witcher Netflix*cough*. Just a massive corporation eating thousands of years of culture and repackaging it into a McDonalds burger. 


P.S.

To give you some at examples, Raya talks about being a dragon nerd, another character mentions cat ladies, and other just annoying quirky banter that is popular among Americans. Just ugh... 

I'm sorry, but just imagine Frodo and Sam chatting about being such gardening nerds, and how some Karen annoyed them, and how Sauron is like totally fascist. I am doing hyperbole obviously, but the point is that it really stings and brings you out of this world."

927,Fantasy,"Why the Best Time to Read Your Bingo Card Is In March; Also Some Stats About My 2 Hard Mode Bingo Cards, First Year Doing Bingo, And Very Short Reviews","This is long. TL;DR: bingo rocks, just join us!

---

First off, thanks to everyone who makes bingo happen! It’s been a lot of fun doing this for the first time. Thanks also to everyone who organized and participated in the Bingo Focus threads, the major Bingo Recommendations thread and all the hundreds of discussions we’ve had over the last year. Without all of you I would never have found most of these books!

I started out reading whatever I wanted for about half a year. The first 10 books or so (all of April and some of May) didn’t even make it onto any card. I filled out quite a bit after that, then had to grit through my less favorite squares / books. 

I finished my first Hard Mode (and Hero Mode) card a month ago. When /u/ Fryktelig_variant mentioned I probably have read enough books to fill out a second card, I realized I could fill out about 70% and only a few least-favorite bingo squares remained. I read another 8 bingo books this month and completed a second card, all in Hard Mode. 

I think my **major takeaway** from bingo is: I read a lot of books I probably wouldn’t otherwise have. I also got to track, follow, revisit all the books I read this year. Normally I shelve, leave a review, and move on with my life. This time I found myself returning often to previously read books, charting them in a spreadsheet, and engaging more with their content (primarily through book club discussions or through recommendation threads but also through Bingo Focus threads and writing this post now). It was nice to engage more over a longer period of time and to look at everything I read again. 

Bingo was also in part a negative experience for me: I forced myself to finish a lot of books I would have DNF otherwise (notably: **Tracks, Nine White Horses, Cinderella is Dead, Dragon Sword and Wind Child, New Wilderness**). Thus, I was often left bitter and angry, and that reflected itself in my reviews. 

Overall I’m pretty happy I did bingo, and I can’t wait for the next card coming out hopefully very soon!!

***What I realized:***

* I love the /r/fantasy book clubs. I love reading along and discussing the books, even the books I don’t fully understand or like. I gain a deeper appreciation (sometimes; not all book clubs are the same). So thank you for pushing me into joining those with the bingo! 

* I hate short story anthologies (**The Merry Spinster**, **Kalpa Imperial**, **Murder By Magic** , **Nine White Horses** were my bane). I am left unsatisfied, underwhelmed and the quality is usually not enough to have me enjoy the majority of the short stories. However, I do very much cherish extra short stories authors write in already beloved worlds (K J Charles, Will Wight, P. Djèlí Clark, D D Webb, Ellen Kushner, Olivia Atwater, Mercedes Lackey, etc). If this is a recurring square, I might be better off reading a lot of single short stories even though it makes a less pretty visual card. 

* I find it really hard to know when a book can fit into a square. I tend to err on the side of it doesn’t fit. E.g. Far more books fall into the BDO umbrella than out of it. But I still don’t see most books as BDO-books. Or, another example, how **The Vampire Knitting Club** is a Book About Books because the MC is looking for her grandmothers grimoire as one of the plot points, but I didn’t realize this until someone else shared their card.

* I should try reading more sci-fi. I tend to veer away from it, but those I did read this year were fairly good. I’ll try to read more for next year.

**Most Binged Author**: Lightning on the Wave (6 out of 7 books) and Will Wight (6 Traveler’s Gate books)

**Bingo-iest Book Read (qualified for the most squares)**:  **Widdershins** by Jordan L Hawk (8) (and yet it didn’t make it onto either card)

Length: 

* **Longest Book Read During Bingo**: **Sacrifices Arc** by Lightning on the Wave - these books each clocked over 1,500 pages, with the longest at 3,500 pages. [It would have been **Twig** by Wildbow / John C McCrae with ~6000 pages, however I listened to the audiobook and they’re only up to Arc 8 or so. Potentially **Critical Role** would also fit here, but I can’t find page equivalents.]

* **Shortest Book Read During Bingo**: Tie between **The Black God's Drums** by P. Djèlí Clark and **Silver in the Wood** by Emily Tesh.  

Publication Date: 

* **Oldest Book Read for Bingo**: **Lord Darcy** omnibus by Randall Garrett (1966) [Next oldest is Which Witch? in 1979, Kalpa Iperial in 1983, Swordspoint in 1987 - I got some old books in y’all!]

* **Newest Book Read for Bingo**: **The Ruthless Lady's Guide to Wizardry** by C.M. Waggoner (Jan 12, 2021) [I also read 5 books published in 2020 - unheard of for me to read so many recently published books.]

Ratings: 

* **Highest GR Average Rating**: **Shadowlord and Pirate King** by Footloose (4.75)

* **Lowest GR Average Rating**: **Tracks** by K M Tolan (3.56) [Upright Women Wanted by Sarah Gailey is up next with 3.77 which surprises me a lot]

* **Most GR Ratings**: Life As We Knew It (Last Survivors, #1) by Susan Beth Pfeffer (120,304 ratings)

* **Least GR Ratings**: **Shadowlord and Pirate King** by Footloose (12) [then Nine White Horses - 24, then Tracks - 27, then Spacious Skies, Amber Waves - 32]

Season: 

* **First Book Read this Bingo Season**: **A Dance of Cloaks** by David Dalglish (only qualified for Self-Pub easy mode)

* **Last Book Read this Bingo Season**: **Nine White Horses** by Judith Tarr

* **Strongest Reading Month**: May 2020 &amp; Feb 2021 (13) - very invested in the beginning and keen to finish at the end.

**Easiest Bingo Square**: Romantic Fantasy - this seems to be my most read square of all of them (45). 
	
**Hardest Bingo Square**: Tie between:  

* *Translated* - I only read two translated books and disliked both of them. This is not part of my normal reading and I don’t think it ever will be.   

* *Graphic Novel / Audiobook / Audiodrama* - I dislike this format and always have. I tried a graphic novel this season and nope, still not my thing.   

* *Canadian Author* - I had to go out of my way to find them which meant I’d less likely just pick one up and read it. 

Bests: 

* **Best Overall Pick**: **Ten Thousand Doors of January** by Alix E Harrow - this book was delightful, emotional, moving and exactly my jam. 

* **Favorite Square**: *Chapter Epigraphs* - I love epigraphs. I only read 5 books that qualify, but I would have read more if there was some easy Epigraphs Database of Books. 

* **Best “I wouldn’t have read this but for bingo""**:  **Half a Soul** by Olivia Atwater - I loved this story and I’m so glad I picked it up!  

* **Best Surprise**: **Critical Role** (Campaign 2: Episodes 1-70) - I started listening to their adventures for something to ‘read’ while knitting. I wasn’t sure if I would like it, be able to follow the story, etc. but it really surprised me how engaged I was. By the time of this posting I’ve listened to a further 10 episodes at least.

* **Most Powerful Book**: **The First Sister** by Linden A Lewis - this book surprised me a lot, both in how good it was, and also in how well it dealt with the subject matter. **Away Childish Things** by lettered is a close second. It’s an amazingly powerful story of compassion, empathy, and understanding. 


Worsts:

* **Worst “I wouldn’t have read this but for bingo""**: **Summon the Keeper** by Tanya Huff - I needed another HM ghost book and this one came up. I read a Huff book years before, disliked it immensely but decided to give her another try. Disliked this one immensely as well. 

* **Biggest Disappointment**: **Cinderella is Dead** - the premise is really great: a young black girl is living a dystopian society that totally bought into the story of Cinderella; all girls are forced to go to balls and find someone to marry, or else something really bad happens. The young girl hates this system and wants to take it down. Great premise. Execution was terrible, however. Feel free to read the GR reviews to understand more. 

* **Most Surprising DNF**: **Wildwood Dancing** by Juliet Marillier - I really wanted to try one of her books, but this was not the one to do it with. It's really over the top in some parts (almost dying from love), very misogynistic (a kid somehow blames all women for his brothers death), and it seems too many plot points for a good story. 

**Book Chosen on Author Alone**: **Nine White Horses** and **Murder By Magic** promised me a Mercedes Lackey story.

**Book Chosen on Title Alone**: **The Ruthless Ladies Guide to Wizardry** by C M Waggoner - That title and cover is just great! Too bad the story wasn't that great. 

**Most Talkative Animal Companion**: A book that didn’t make it onto my card: **Freedom and Not Peace** by Lightning on the Wave - Harry bonds to a magical serpent that interweaves itself into his mind. She is very chatty and constantly butts in. Later he bonds to an Omen snake, and while still talkative, he’s not that talkative. For one on my card, the closest is **The Witches of Eileanan** by Kate Forsyth, but the animal tends to talk to a minor character, and we don’t hear him much.

***Mini Reviews***

If you want to read my long-form reviews, you can see my special Bingo 2020-2021 Shelf [here]( https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3584794?shelf=bingo-20-21).

**Row 1**

1\. [Translated novel (HM: by a woman)]

* **Kalpa Imperial** by Angélica Gorodischer - I only read this for the book club. I liked some stories, disliked others, and overall it was interesting to see how empires rise and fall. **4/5 stars**

* **Dragon Sword and Wind Child** by Noriko Ogiwara - I disliked how women were treated (but really anyone deemed ‘lesser’) and how illogical the story was, too much to enjoy anything else. **1/5 stars**

2\. [Snow, ice, or cold (HM: entire book)]
	
* **Spinning Silver** by Naomi Novik - An absolutely beautiful story. I loved the intertwining of fairytales and heroic women, each their own style. **5/5 stars**

* **Loki: Where Mischief Lies** by Mackenzie Lee - I first read The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue by Lee, and enjoyed it enough to give this one a try. This one was just very… Marvel. Too much not my thing. I was hoping for more mythological Loki. **3/5 stars**

3\. [Optimistic (HM: not Becky Chambers)]

* **Lost Lake** by Sarah Addison Allen - One of my absolute favorite authors ever. This story was not my favorite by hers, but still left me feeling warm and fuzzy inside. **4/5 stars**

* **Curse of Chalion** by Lois McMaster Bujold - My first Bujold! Definitely great writing, however the icky “romance” underlying the story did not work for me at all. **5/5 stars**

4\. [Necromancer (HM: main character)]

* **Penny For Your Soul** by K.A. Ashcomb - A really surprising book (in a great way!) I took a few months off to read some books on finances, banking, economy, etc. and then I could understand what was happening a lot better. I loved the tone and the characters. **4/5 stars**

* **Which Witch?** by Iva Ibbotson- This is a middle grade book I happened to pick up and turned out to be far better than expected. Funny characters, but a bit of an odd tone throughout. **4/5 stars**

5\. [Asexual/Aromantic (HM: main character)]

* **Sufficiently Advanced Magic** by Andrew Rowe - You can tell this was a self-published story. I liked some parts, but overall it was not strong enough for me. The second book was better. But I don’t think I’ll be reading any more by this author. **2/5 stars**

* **The Cybernetic Tea Shop** by Meredish Katz - Again, a great world I would have loved to stay longer in and explore more in, but that’s a novella for you. **4/5 stars**

**Row 2**

6\. [Ghost (HM: main character)]

* **The Last to See Me** by M. Dressler  - Another book that started out strong and ended on a ‘huh?’. A book written from the ghosts perspective is a great idea. I just don’t get the ending at all. **3/5 stars**

* **Summon the Keeper** by Tanya Huff - I think this book was supposed to be funny. It’s not my type of humor. It’s not my writing style. Second attempt at trying to read Huff and I’m happy to never try again. **1/5 stars**

7\. [Exploration (HM: main plot)]

* **A Natural History of Dragons** by Marie Brennan - I found this quite lackluster. It was both boring and anxiety inducing at the same time. I had a lot of difficulty reading it, and I’m not sure why. I don’t think I’ll continue the series. **3/5 stars**

* **Steerswoman** by Rosemary Kirstein - I liked a lot going on here: interesting world with minimal sexual violence, exploration on a more local level, interesting characters. **4/5 stars**

8\. [Climate Fiction (HM: not post-apocalyptic)

*  **The New Wilderness** by Diane Cook - Wonderful, interesting premise that just completely lost where it was going half way and then died by the end. Also very illogical. **2/5 stars**

* **The Black God’s Drums** by P Djéli Clark - I didn’t realized I needed a steampunk New Orleans story, but I so did. This was what I was hoping The Salt Roads would be. I just wish it wasn’t a novella! **4/5 stars**

9\. [Color in title (HM: not red, white, black, gray)]

* **The Crimson Vault** by Will Wight - The whole Traveler’s Gate series was enjoyable, if a bit simple. I liked the training parts. I liked how the last book subverted expectations a bit. But nothing was that stand out. **4/5 stars**

* **Silver in the Wood** by Emily Tesh - I loved this book. It is the perfect novella: self-contained romance with a HEA, a strong plot, beautiful forest imagery that sets my imagination spinning. **5/5 stars**

**Row 3**

10\. [r/Fantasy book club (HM: current and participate)]

* **King's Dragon** by Kate Elliott - I always wanted to read this series and the (ongoing) book club read was a great reason to. Unfortunately there is a ton of rape, brutal existence, war, etc. in these books and I find it too hard to finish the series. **5/5 stars**

* **The Last Sun** by K D Edwards - This book was fun, with some really strange elements tossed together (tarot, Atlantis, magic, modern lifestyles) but somehow it worked. The characters carried this story for me, however. **4/5 stars**

11\. [Self-published (HM: &lt;50 GR ratings)]

* **Spacious Skies, Amber Waves** by D. D. Webb - I love this entire series. I could have picked any of the books, but picked this one due to the lovely title. One of my top favorite series of all time, so go read it. **5/5 stars**

* **A Song In Time of Revolution** by Lightning on the Wave - The 6th book of the 7 book retelling of Harry Potter (in which he has a twin brother, and is sorted into Slytherin and endures a lot of child abuse by his parents). It’s amazing. I love this series a lot, though it’s hard reading at times. **5/5 stars**

12\. [Chapter epigraphs (HM: original to novel)]

* **Burning Bright** by Melissa McShane - There were some glaring issues with this book I couldn’t look past. Women were treated so badly. I wanted pirates in the jungle and got misogyny and disappointment instead. **3/5 stars**

* **The Secret Casebook of Simon Feximal** by K J Charles - Simon Feximal is a ghost hunter and his partner is writing their memoir. K J Charles is just an excellent author who captures the forbidden romance of LGBT couples in historical context so well. **4/5 stars**

13\. [Published in 2020 (HM: debut)]

*  **The First Sister** by Linden A. Lewis - One of the few sci-fi books I not only finished but also loved. An excellent debut novel; I can’t wait for the sequel. **5/5 stars**

*  **Upright Women Wanted** by Sarah Gailey - As with most novellas, I found this too short. There was so much to explore here, and instead we got only a glimpse. Interesting world and interesting mobile librarians, however! **3/5 stars**

14\. [University or school (HM: not Harry Potter or Magicians)]

*  **Lord of the White Hell, Book 1** by Ginn Hale - First half of this story takes place in a school, is fairly straight forward and is a wonderful burgeoning relationship. The second half changes a lot of that, and I’m not sure I want to continue reading in this world after finishing it. **5/5 stars**

* **Mage Errant** by John Bierce - This just felt like a Sufficiently Advanced Magic rip-off, that was slightly better written. **2/5 stars**

15\. [Book about books (HM: not a library)]

* **The Ten Thousand Doors of January** by Alix E. Harrow - I didn’t know what to expect going in, just that everyone loves this book. I read it, and I loved this book. **5/5 stars**

* **The Vampire Knitting Club** by Nancy Warren - I wanted more knitting and instead got a book in which the protagonist doesn’t even know how to knit. Or do much else. **2/5 stars**

**Row 4**

16\. [Makes you laugh (HM: not Pratchett)]

* **Away Childish Things** by lettered - Amazing Harry Potter fanfiction in which Harry reverts back to a child and Draco has to find a way to de-age him again. Then it happens to Draco. They both get to see each other from that adult vs child perspective and it’s the most beautiful touching development of empathy I’ve seen written. **5/5 stars**

* **Shadowlord and Pirate King** by Footloose - A loosely-inspired Merlin fanfic in which Merlin is a magical space ninja and King Arthur is the rugged space pirate king. It sounds absurd, but it was really well done. Also it had a great ending. **5/5 stars**

17\. [Short stories (HM: collection)]

* **Murder By Magic** by Rosemary Edgehill - Very dated short stories. I was expecting something different. And the one Lackey story was one I already knew. **2/5 stars**

* **Lord Darcy** by Randall Garrett - One of the few short story collections I enjoyed. There was a lot of repetition, and it’s definitely a product of its age, however as far as magical murders go it was pretty good. **5/5 stars**

18\. [Big dumb object (HM: Golden Age sci-fi)]

* **Life As We Knew It** by Susan Beth Pfeffer - This is written as the diary of a teenager as the world completely changes and she loses her typical modern teenage lifestyle. This book was great; a further look into the series, however, made me feel I’m better off stopping right here. **5/5 stars**

* **Sleeping Giants** by Sylvain Neuvel - I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. I had no idea where the story was going even up until the end. It’s always interesting to explore human psychology through the guise of aliens and their creations. **4/5 stars**

19\. [Feminist (HM: PoC woman)]

* **Cinderella is Dead** by Kalynn Bayron - I gave this one a second star for the attempt. But it was pretty bad. Super tropey, far too many plot lines competing for attention and half that went no where. **2/5 stars**

*  **In the Vannishers’ Palace** by Aliette de Bodard - I have heard a lot about this book before I ever read it, and it ended up being even stranger than most reviews describe. I can’t wrap my mind around the geometry. And the whole thing felt too short. **2/5 stars**

20\. [Canadian (HM: small press or self-pubbed)]

* **Tracks** by K.M. Tolan - The less said the better. This had all the typical YA flaws and then some. **1/5 stars**

* **Half a Soul** by Olivia Atwater - A really nice surprise, finding a beautiful regency tale, some evil fae-type creatures, and a very interesting protagonist in one. I can’t wait to read more. **5/5 stars**

**Row 5**

21\. [Number in title (HM: also color)]

* **Six-Gun Snow White** by Catherynne M. Valente - An interesting premise to be sure. I love fantasy westerns, but this one was almost too weird. **3/5 stars**

* **Nine White Horses** by Judith Tarr  - A short story anthology that ran the gauntlet from weird time travel gods to immortal horses to rape apologizing. **1/5 stars**

22\. [Romantic (HM: HEA and participate)]

* **Empire of Sand** by Tasha Suri - Book club read that I partly really liked (excellent consent-based romance) and also felt there wasn’t enough of (how does the magic actually work?). **4/5 stars**

* **The Ruthless Ladies Guide to Wizardry** by C M Waggoner - A somewhat lackluster book that left a lot of questions remaining. Still, a very interesting world to explore. **4/5 stars**

23\. [Magical pet (HM: can speak)]

* **The Starless Sea** by Erin Morgenstern - There is one cat that says one word, okay? I actually loved this book with all my heart. I want to reread it again so badly, but I need more time. It’s so magical and wonderful. **5/5 stars**

* **The Witches of Eileanan** by Kate Forsyth - Aside from the child being tortured and raped out of nowhere, this is a really great book. Still, that part put me off from reading the rest of the series. **4/5 stars**
 
24\. [Audiobook/drama (HM:  &gt;25 hour audio)]

* **Campaign 2: Episodes 1-65** by Critical Role - I’ve listen to up to Episode 80 or so by now. They are so charming and wonderful to listen to. **5/5 stars**

* **Twig** by Wildbow - The audiobook is only about 8 arcs in, but it’s still a great story to listen to. Wildbow just writes so well. **5/5 stars**

25\. [Politics (HM: not featuring royalty)]

* **A Conspiracy of Truths** by Alexandra Rowland - My most favorite new author this year. This book was exceptional. I am putting off reading the sequel to make the pleasure last. **5/5 stars**

* **Swordspoint** by Ellen Kushner - Surprisingly good older stories that have little to no fantasy elements. **4/5 stars**

---

**Honorable Mentions**: Books that didn't make it on my card but I still through were great:

* **A Night in the Lonesome October** by Roger Zelazny 

* **Sorcery &amp; Cecelia: or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot** by Patricia C Wrede

* **Wicked Gentlemen** by Ginn Hale

* **The Magpie Lord** by K J Charles

928,Fantasy,Just finished Mistborn: The Hero of Ages....was not a big fan of the ending,"So I just finished the conclusion of the Mistborn trilogy, and I know it gets posted about a lot but I mainly wanted to discuss the ending, as it seems to be something that is very highly praised but it just...didn't hit for me. I've already [elaborated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/jttjv7/mistborn_the_well_of_ascension_a_disappointing/) in a previous post that I haven't been particularly impressed with this series, and I thought book 2 was a particular step down from the compelling first book, The Final Empire. While book 3 was better than the second book, I find it was ultimately a slight letdown for me.

 The entire ending sequence was frankly a bit too out of left field for me. For instance, on Sazed being the Hero of Ages: I don't have an inherent problem with that idea. Throughout the book I was suspecting if it was actually Sazed considering the pre-chapter epigraphs very much sounded like him, so it was cool to see my theory confirmed. However, him becoming *literally* God felt like a jumping the shark moment for me. Like, okay, if he just used the power to remake the world like Rashek did, I'd be fine with that, but Sazed becoming an omniscient, supreme being just did not feel like the most satisfying or sensible ending for the story at hand. I did find his struggles with religion intriguing, but the fact that that struggle ends with him becoming God is just a bit absurd.

I was also not a big fan of Vin and Elend's deaths. Okay, so it's definitely a bold choice for Sanderon to kill both of his main characters, and partially this may just be me being sad, but ultimately it just felt like unnecessary shock value. I dislike that Vin's grand conclusion, the culmination of her compelling arc from scared girl to confident young empress, was her becoming a shapeless divine blob and....absorbing Ruin? Something like that. She had an excellent, series-defining moment of badassery in her fight with the Inquisitors and her obliteration of Luthadel (seriously, this fight scene was awesome), but I feel like Sanderson just lets her character down at the end. Elend too, his death felt pretty random. It is quite tragic that both of them died so young, but idk, it just didn't feel necessary. They deserved better.

Ultimately, I think it's an adequate ending, but it left me wanting. Certain characters get shafted (TenSoon should have gotten revived at the very least....), and certain plotlines feel a bit superfluous like the entire Urteau plotline, even if it was a pretty good plot in a vacuum and contained some interesting development for the character of Spook. Sanderson does do a great job of building up the feeling of despair though, great apocalyptic vibes all around. I just think it's unfortunate that the first book in the series ended up being the best one. I may have also suffered from a case of heightened expectations due to the fact that the last series I read before this one was A Song of Ice and Fire, which I found much better than this. What are your guys' thoughts on this book?"
929,Fantasy,JJ vs Breach of Peace by Daniel B. Greene: A Book Review,"Breach of Peace by Daniel B. Greene is ostensibly an urban fantasy police procedural. It features a trio of investigators, called the Officers of God, in a sort of Edwardian city ruled by an authoritarian godking. The book begins with an investigation of a gruesome multiple murder. Bodies are broken, splayed, and hung. It’s clear that it’s a message. But for whom? And from whom?

We follow Khlid, the lead investigator on the case. She’s a dutiful cop, a smoker, and is married to fellow officer of god, Samuel. Honestly there isn't a ton else to say about her. She’s not particularly compelling or charming or charismatic. She just sort of...is. The other two feel similarly underdeveloped. Chapman is brash and tattooed and is just so darn good at his job that everybody hates him (or so we’re told), and the aforementioned Samuel is completely forgettable. He’s superfluous and, as far as I can see, only exists as an attempt to humanize Khlid.

But it’s the darndest thing about these investigators...they do very little investigating. Almost none really. Or none that we see. Greene doesn’t seem particularly concerned with doing the work of a mystery story. There are no clues or suspects or interrogations or even any real deductions. At one point Khlid *says* that the most important part of an investigation is the research but it gets ignored in favour of the next plot point (which also happens to solve the mystery). It's a story about investigators who don’t investigate. 

So if that’s the case, why bother making them investigators? The events in this book could happen to anybody but Greene seems to want to *say* something about police or about the nature of authority. I'm just not sure he knows what he wants to say or how to say it. 

We’re told that the police have been de-militarized and have become a much respected and lauded civilian force, that they are answerable to the community first and foremost, and have even set up soup kitchens and shelters for the betterment of all. It feels like Greene is addressing the current American political climate by reassuring the reader that these cops are different but it rings hollow. Doubly so because he goes back on it later in the story when Khlid casually says ""disobeying an officer of god during a raid is punishable by death"". It’s confusing messaging. 

But overall Breach of Peace is readable and clear and doesn't stumble over itself like some of the self-pub I've read. The prose isn’t particularly clever or compelling but it’s unobtrusive and gets the job done. However, the book is, at best, a fragment of a story; an introduction. It reads like a prologue to something bigger.

This is partially because the whole story takes place over a handful of hours which doesn’t give Greene a ton of time to establish suspense or tension or even develop his plot. The entire first third of the book is taken up by the initial investigation then it shifts to an expository meeting between two characters and then lurches into the climax. It doesn’t feel like Greene uses the space wisely and the story ends up feeling more like an extended short story than a fully realized novella. 

But the overall premise of the book is fun and if Greene follows the normal Urban Fantasy trajectory it could make an excellent source for monster of the week storytelling. The horror elements are much appreciated, if a little clumsy, and he rides the line between fun dark and depressing dark rather well. 

I don’t necessarily think this is a *bad* book; it's just not a particularly good one either. The negatives certainly outweigh the positives for me but when all added up the negatives really only amount to a “meh”. The characters are perfunctory, the plot is dull, the mystery is flawed  but it reads super quickly, the premise is decent, and the horror bits mostly work. I wouldn't recommend it but I wouldn't try to stop you either."

&gt;Among the ashes of a dying world, an agent of the Commandant finds a letter. It reads: Burn before reading. Thus begins an unlikely correspondence between two rival agents hellbent on securing the best possible future for their warring factions. Now, what began as a taunt, a battlefield boast, grows into something more. Something epic. Something romantic. Something that could change the past and the future.

Pretty darned brilliant, especially if you appreciate un-cliched characters, excellent but restrained worldbuilding, and Parker-Chan's gift for breaking you. *(Ebook)*
* [**The Blacktongue Thief (Blacktongue, #1)**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55077697-the-blacktongue-thief) (*NetGalley ARC*) by Christopher Buehlman (4.75/5) - I've read everything Buehlman has published and loved all of it. To say I had high expectations from his fantasy debut is an understatement of the year. Happily, Buehlman has delivered.
* [**Migrations**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42121525-migrations) by Charlotte McConaghy (4.5/5) - A remarkable read. Set in the future, where climate change has almost completely wiped out the wildlife, it follows a woman determined to track the last remaining Arctic terns on their ultimate migration. It has a peculiar, otherworldly, quality and dark atmosphere. It's filled with grief and sadness, and it gives little hope for a better tomorrow. I loved it nonetheless. *(Ebook)*

The first man. Created before Death, Adam has lived countless lives. When his last job ends in a disaster, he takes on a new identity. This time, however, things get more complicated than usual. After meeting with The Rook, Adam starts a quest to recover scattered elements from the Garden of Eden. *(Ebook)*

How do I rate it? It shines with fascinating and creative ideas, dense and evocative writing, and strong characters. Parts of the story are PHENOMENAL. Unfortunately, all of this gets bogged down by lots of exposition and info-dumping. The end result is uneven - with sky-high ups, but also some downs. 3.5, I guess, is the right score but don't let it detract you from trying this one. I'll preorder book two as soon as it's possible. I just hope it won't contain as much backstory and lore as *The Helm of Midnight. (Ebook)*
* [**Jillian vs Parasite Planet**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55244063-jillian-vs-parasite-planet) (*NetGalley ARC*) by Nicole Kornher-Stace (3.5/5) - an uplifting and adventurous middle-grade book about Jillian facing parasite planet. It was fun, but as with most middle-grade books the stakes weren't too high and you simply know that everything will turn out to be ok in the end. Still worth a read. And if you have a child, read it to them! *(Ebook)*

* [**Machinehood**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56629360-machinehood) by S.B. Divya, narrated by  Inés del Castillo and Deepti Gupti (4/5) - *Machinehood* is executed in a clean, concise style, with a narrative as logical as it is unpredictable. It's brainy, it asks a lot of questions and doesn't deliver all the answers. It presents a disquieting power struggle and provides a fully imagined idea of where humanity is headed. Well worth a read.
* [**The Vanished Birds**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48738919-the-vanished-birds) by Simon Jimenez narrated by Shayna Small (4/5) - very unusual, difficult to describe and make justice to. A space opera but also a love story, and heartbreak story, and much more.

* [**Essex County**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6096829-essex-county) by Jeff Lemire (5/5) - A collection of three graphic short stories set in Essex County, Ontario. Also, a terrific read. It's one of the best graphic novels I've ever read.
* [**Kill or Be Killed**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44289251-kill-or-be-killed) by Ed Brubaker (5/5) - Fairy tales are full of good guys and bad guys and good guys usually win. Then, they have a cake and the princess. Unfortunately, the real world isn't like that. In the real world, the bad guys have already won and tend to rewrite the rules in their own favor. *Kill or be Killed* follows a man who stopped putting up with it all. Armed with a gun, hidden behind a mask, he starts to kill bad guys. Because violence begets more violence, innocents are killed. There's also a demon forcing our (anti)hero to bring justice. Possibly, cause he can also be on the wrong meds. All told, it's an excellent and addictive graphic novel with a unique take on vigilantism.

And rather sad. The conclusion shows that there can be no peace where humans are involved. Humanity has twisted the gift of creation and built slaves, not companions. When machinekind fought back, the fear led humanity to hunt robots down and destroy them. In the end, though, organic lifeforms are just meat. Soft and full of fear. And dreams. I loved the ending; It's darker than I expected from this story but leaves a glimmer of hope.
* [**Angel Catbird, Vol. 1 (Angel Catbird, #1**)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28146168-angel-catbird-vol-1) by Margaret Atwood (2/5) - Disappointing. Despite having a tongue-in-cheek tone and providing genuinely funny moments, it offers little substance. A waste of time, to be honest.

*The Expanse* season 5 - It's probably the best sci-fi TV series ever. I loved season 5. I can't wait for season 6.

I've read a few amazing titles this month. Wise readers should pre-order *She Who Became The Sun* and *The Blacktongue Thief* ASAP. Curious readers would do well to check *Birds of Paradise* as well. Everyone should check Essex County by Lemire. Everyone with a reasonable tolerance to violence should check *Kill or be Killed* by Brubaker. And you can't go wrong with *Descender.*

* Have you read any of these books? Do you agree with my assessment?
* If not, what have you read in March? And how did you split your media consumption between different formats (ebooks, physical copies, audiobooks)?

935,Fantasy,What does it take to make you shove a book to the very top of your TBR list?,"So I'm diving deep into progression fantasy of late, and many, *many* people have recommended *Mother of Learning* voraciously. It sounds amazing, and the more I hear about it, the more excited I am to get to it, to the point that it has been tossed to the very top of my TBR list, to be picked up right after I get through *A Deadly Education.*

This is pretty uncommon for me, typically. I have an entire list of reads (like most everyone on this sub, I imagine), and while I don't usually read top-down in perfect order, I do scan said list for my next read whenever I'm done with something, searching for a story that fits the mood I'm looking for. As a result, it's rare for something to get locked-in as ""*THIS. This* is what I'm reading next.""

939,Fantasy,Percy Jackson inspired me to start reading again.,"I've read many series and I usually gulp them down in a very short time. Once I've done major, popular series I felt like I'm done - the fire, the passion has gone out and every time I tried to burn it up - the books wouldn't inspire, intrigue and ""swallow"" me into their world.









I've put away Percy Jackson for personal reasons - I was young and simply couldn't get over the fact that my favourite Greek myths would be so americanised and made look cheap. But maybe it's because I first got acquainted with the universe through the film and back then I didn't think that books are always better.
I first watched the film almost 10 years ago and had vague but negative memories. Too teenagery I thought (ironic huh?), too americano and overall a sacrilege to Greek mythology.










Later on, I accidentally came across a post of Disney planning a remake a couple a days ago. So I thought ""After All, Why Not? Why Shouldn't I Read It? (Got the reference? 😏)"". Between the last time I've seen the film and then, I had watched and played games with maaaaaaaany various interpretations of Greek mythology. That helped me to be more open towards various ways to tell those stories.









So I gave it a start and oh my Olympian God! I wasn't ready for such an emotional roller-coaster - from laughing out loud, to cringe and even emotional moments (especially the end of book two, where Tyson tells Percy, that their father heard his prayers and send Percy - his brother - to his aid) that made me produce a salted water droplet from my eye.









The book is so good compared to the film and I actually love everything I hated about this book back then...."

941,Fantasy,What fantasy novel or series do you think “ripped off” the Star Wars OT the most?,"I know Star Wars is designed to follow the hero’s journey and uses a lot of fantasy tropes, but what fantasy books or series that came out after it clearly borrowed a lot from Star Wars?"
942,Fantasy,Book Review: Equal Rites by Terry Pratchett,"The Unseen University, the centre of magical learning on the Discworld, a building whose endless rooftops make Gormenghast look like a toolshed on a railway allotment and whose faculty are the guardians of magic for the whole world. Of course, wizards are renowned for being incredibly intelligent but not very smart, and when Drum Billet realises his time is almost up he decides to pass on his staff to the eighth son of a poor blacksmith, himself an eighth son, and thus a potential great wizard. Unfortunately, he neglects to check the baby's gender first...

After two unexpectedly bestselling novels, Terry Pratchett changed gears in his writing career. He quit his day job as a press officer for a nuclear power station and became a full-time writer, churning out two volumes a year for more than a decade. He also adjusted his vision of what the **Discworld** series could be. No more a series of satires of fantasy or fairy tale tropes, he decided that he could take any subject and make a **Discworld** novel about it.

*Equal Rites* is the first novel to employ this approach. No previous characters from the first two books turn up (with one orange-furred and banana-stained exception), and there isn't even any mention of those events. Instead we have new characters having new adventures. Pratchett also starts to use his creation to address real-world concerns here, in this case, well, equal rights for those of a nonmale persuasion. The humour remains fairly broad, but you can almost sense the author thinking at this point that maybe the funny planet with the turtle and elephants can be used for something more interesting than just poking fun at Lovecraft and **Conan the Barbarian**, amusing as that may be. Unfortunately, this idea falters a bit since Esk's story is meant to make Unseen University a co-ed establishment, bringing in female wizards and making it more equal. As later books show, none of this happens, Esk doesn't show up again until more than thirty books down the line and UU remains a male-only establishment in the later novels. Given how well Pratchett develops his world, this lack of evolution is mildly disappointing.

That's more a problem with the later books than this one, though. As with several other early **Discworld** books, there is something of a lack of focus here. The book starts off as a travelogue, with Granny Weatherwax and Esk travelling to Ankh-Morpork from the tiny Ramtops village of Bad Ass (later retconned into the Kingdom of Lancre, the setting for many later books), though the limited page count (*Equal Rites* barely cracks 200 pages in paperback) and the need for a Big Finale in Ankh-Morpork curtails this element just as it's getting interesting and we quickly (via a jump-started, second-hand broomstick) move to the city and the ending which - and stop me if you've  heard this one before - involves the threat of Unspeakable Things from the Dungeon Dimensions erupting through the skein of reality to destroy the universe. Again.

In terms of character, it's hard to argue with the book: Esk is a well-defined protagonist and Granny Weatherwax, of course, is one of Pratchett's signature characters, a formidable and solid figure whose common sense sometimes feels a bit adrift in a world as off-kilter as this one (Pratchett uses the Only Sane Person idea a lot in the series, but none are saner than Granny Weatherwax). This is still very much a proto-Granny, not the much more complex and sophisticated character of the later novels, but it's fun to revisit the somewhat simpler village witch and see her evolution and growth into a stronger and more interesting figure. Among **Discworld** characters, only arguably Sam Vimes of the City Watch can match this kind of evolution. We also get our first sympathetic Archchancellor of Unseen University, Cutangle, and it's rather a shame he doesn't show up again (though given the events of *Sourcery*, that might be for the best, for him at any rate). 

*Equal Rites* (\*\*\*½) is important as the first **Discworld** novel where Pratchett changes gears and realises he can tell self-contained stories about this world not involving Rincewind and Twoflower, and use the **Discworld** as a reflection for real-world concerns as well as simply being funny. It's still Early Pratchett, with a bit of a reliance on standby ideas, but you can see the growing ambition and craft on display here."

948,Fantasy,Review of 'Ahsoka',"Hello All,

I read this book today and reviewed it. The short text review follows ( a semi-animated version is available on [youtube](https://youtu.be/cRKqoPircso)). Hope y'all like it.

There are spoilers for the Star Wars animated series - Clone Wars and Rebels, but there are none for the book per se.

\--------------------------------------------

'Ahsoka' is a Disney Canon novel published in 2016 - but one that I read just now. It fills in the bits of Ahsoka's story from &gt;!her escape from Order 66 to her taking on the mantle of 'Fulcrum', whom we see in Rebels. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

If you are not familiar with the character, here is a short introduction. Ahsoka Tano became Anakin Skywalker's Padawan in The Clone Wars animated movie and series. Her introduction was controversial, but soon, she won over fans due to her plucky nature and her snippy attitude with Anakin. &gt;!In later seasons, Ahsoka left the Jedi Order. Her next canonical appearance is in the Rebels animation series, where she is older and leading a resistance against the Empire. Post-that she made her appearance in an episode of 'The Mandalorian'.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

This book is a mixed bag.

&amp;#x200B;

On the positive side, this portion of Ahsoka's life has been a mystery, and many a Star Wars fan will be happy to know what she was up to during the Empire's takeover, myself included. 

&amp;#x200B;

The book also delves into her frustration between upholding the Jedi Order's ideals versus the Order's actions in the Clone Wars. &gt;!We see the logical conclusion of this dilemma, which started when Padawan Bariss framed her and made her question what the Jedi were doing!&lt;. There are also appearances and references to many characters from all across the Star Wars universe. 

&amp;#x200B;

But that said, there is plenty that needs improvement too. 

&amp;#x200B;

For one, the book is too short. Then, there is a  love story element that is out of place and doesn't go anywhere. Finally, most of the book's essential beats have been set up earlier - so the book does not have much to offer beyond filling in some of the missing portions of Ahsoka's story.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, if you are a fan of the character, this book will probably appeal to you. For others, it is average and is best read if there isn't anything else available.

949,Fantasy,Is this story good.,"This is a story about a brawler. His name was Kito.
Born in a peaceful Village during the GI era. He had an Elder Sister who he loved and cared for. His elder sister was very kind and caring. He lived with his parents and Elder Sister. Unfortunately his Sister got an illness called the Greening Disease. It's an illness that only effect teen girls from 10-19 years of age. They mostly die within 10 years.

Out of fear of the disease spreading, Kite's parents sent his sister to live in Green Village, a closed community located on the outskirts of what would later become the Magic Kingdom of Zeth designed to quarantine girls suffering from the disease. Kite, then only five years old, made several attempts to travel to Green Village to visit his sister, but was caught by his parents each time and beaten as punishment. Believing his physical weakness to be the thing separating him from his beloved older sister, Kite abandoned his parents and set out into the world to train himself to become stronger. 

During his training, Kite discovered that he possessed an affinity for martial arts, particularly kenpo. This great natural talent allowed him to quickly develop his skills through rigorous training until he was able to enter and win a high profile fighting tournament at the very young age of 15. Following his victory, Kite believed himself to have finally become strong enough to enter Green Village and reunite with his sister. He traveled to the isolated village alone, single-handedly fighting through the Monster-infested and maze-like forest it was hidden within, only to learn upon his arrival that his sister had long since passed away. As if to punctuate his trauma, he was unable to determine whether his sister had been killed by her disease or by one of the many monsters that routinely invaded the village, preventing him from even being able to properly grieve for her. 

Heartbroken by the discovery, Kite became disgusted with the treatment of the girls who inhabited Green Village, and vowed to dedicate the rest of his life to protecting them in order to prevent them from suffering in the same way that his sister did. Using the prize money he obtained from the tournament, he bought the girls of the village food, supplies, and medicine that was otherwise unavailable to them. He then entered several additional fighting tournaments, using all of the wealth that he amassed from his victories to support the village, hoping that he would be able to allow them to live more comfortable lives until a cure for the disease was discovered. All the while, he regularly patrolled the village's perimeter and fought off any monsters that attempted to enter it. 

Over time, Kite successfully won every single organized fighting tournament available to him on The Continent. This caused him to become a legendary figure throughout the Human Realm, with many declaring him to be the single strongest man alive. Despite this praise, Kite remained cold towards the humans who lived outside of Green Village, seeing them only as selfish creatures who were content to abandon the girls to their misfortune rather than try and struggle to find them a cure. Eventually, he came to believe that humanity would never make the effort to cure greening disease, making him the only thing standing between the girls who had contracted it and complete misery. These beliefs caused him to venture into the Monster Realm and request for the Demon King Gi to transform him into a Dark Lord, hoping to increase his lifespan to allow him to continue protecting the denizens of Green Village for eternity. Likely due to Kite's outstanding strength, Gi accepted his request. 

Also by the way this is a story from a porn game called Rance. Also Kaito didn't do any sex in the Visual Novel story. He was an antagonist character. I mainly wanted to make a point that even Porn games can have good story."

951,Fantasy,Anyone else gets turned off completely by 'end of an era' storylines?,"I love worldbuilding in fantasy, so much as that immersion for me is a big topic. I like to be fully immersed in the world while I worry abou the fate of **characters**

What ruins the experience for me is misplacing the suspense by making the axe of suspence hover over the worldbuilding itself. See all this egyptian-style setting I just built? I think it's about to come to an end! This is what I call misplaced anxiety. I worry too much about the world itself that I stop being invested in it and its characters. 

Examples: This is what happened in Pirates of the Caribbean 3 and Ice Age 2, as a kid, those had the big plotlines that 'the age that defines the series is about to be over.'

Spoiler alert, the world survives, nothing drastic happens, but the experience was still ruined for me as I lost my interest. 

\------------

This is why in general, I am not a great fan of transitional periods, between the victorian and ww1 or between the ages of swords and chivalry and the age of pragmatic gunpowder pew pew as the world seems to be undecided and unwelcoming as far as immersion goes. 

Same goes for 'magic is going away,' and 'past the golden age waning periods,' etc"

        ""The sweetest blood is the one spouting from a Lantharr skull""
                -The Merciful Archangel Androxath-
It takes six full hours of broad daylight to melt away the ice spikes on a field after an ice shard shower -a deadly but common natural event in winter- if one were to take a look at its aftermath, they wouldn't see but a repeating pattern of white lines converging upwards into a pointy end, and a zigzag horizon, what doesn't remain consistent though, is the frequency of the red spots staining the canvas, those are the poor Lantharr souls who have met their demise travelling, transporting goods from city to city for their Dimerian masters, Work hours are when showers deal the most damage, the trade routes start smelling worse than an Axomalan street when a manhole is opened.


PROLOGUE

Standing at around five miles west of Bampa Forest, over a frozen river, a stone bridge, moderately weathered hosted a buildup of snow.
Hiding under the shade of the bridge stood Talos Koreel, a short and white skinned Lanth, he had spent the better part of an hour scouting cautiously, flailing his left copper arm around evry few minutes to keep the frozen water droplets from jamming the gears inside, he hated this arm, having to feed it coal and warm water twice a day felt no short of a Pendangian task, he would despise himself for having lost his fleshy arm everytime he was abed but he kept telling himself it was worth it, for some reason the feeble mind of a Lantharr favored that time for remorse, and it killed him not knowing why.


A dozen minutes later, he heard a high pitched knock, something like a fork clanging to a glass, he looked down and noticed the ice surface shatter, an iron hatch emerged off the water, opened and pushed away the ice blocks floating. A tall yet young woman climbed out of the hole, she stood up and brushed dust off her eskimo suit, maintaining a stale face while looking at him until she cracked a smile.

Talos did not do the same, he nodded upwards towards the hatch and said "" For how long has this been here?""

""Long enough for a socially isolated person like you to notice""

He did not laugh.

She sighed"" do you wish to talk about *your own* city expanding while, tireless workers are building tunnels and connecting cities, and you're not even aware of it? It has been two years since this underground hatch was dug since you are asking""

""Why does it matter?"" He showed no sign of interest.

""What could possibly make your research worth neglecting your own people?"" Before he knew it she her voice grew significantly louder "" Need I remind you that you"" she was screaming now ""swore an oath to serve the city of Kareel the day you founde-

""Lower your voice Tina, are you trying to undo its years of secrecy?""

""So you have finally decided to care?""

He did not answer, taking advantage of the awkward silence that ensued, he took time to fully absorb his surroundings, he had been so concentrated on the conversation he didn't realise it started snowing, he noticed a peculiar decently large grey brown rock six feet from him, it felt queer, though he could not pinpoint what made it stand out, snow had covered the transluscent surface of the ice covering the river, it blended with the snowy land.

""Why did you summon me here brother?"" Tina broke the silence.

""I wished to update you on my research""

""You have never done that before"" she raised a brow "" should i expect a technological breakthrough""

""More of a biological and magical one in kind, but certantly a significant one"", after minutes of conversation, he finally smiled.

""I'm listening""

""The Dimephytes, extinct magical plants that existed everywhere in Azura eons ago, have gone through all sorts of decompositions, although they have retained their Dimerium energy, it has changed nature, like a windmill spinning backwards, it's effects have reversed, it can cause important fluctuations in the Dimerian link of living tissue and Dimerian souls alike, and both further exposition and a high concentration of such remains can temporarely sever the link""

""Wow"" she said with such a wonder and childlike curiosity. It reminded him of his daughter when she had unraveled her very first gift, a cheap wool doll, he had worked himself for years and saved up so much, although it took a toll on his health, and he had to amputate his arm, Shalara was happy.

""These remains, most are what makes a Dimerian being, that explains why they have magic abilities and we don't, but the rest condensed into carbon heavy mineral components also known as"" he took out a brown cloth pouch and emptied its contents on the palm of his hands ""Coal"", Tina Grabbed one of the smaller chunks and contemplated the random pattern it formed.
""This mundane material can sever the  bond between a soul and the dimerium itself!""he looked at her half expecting a gasp, but was dissapointed to find her suspended, still waiting for a simplified conclusion

He sighed and finished "" It basically renders Dimerians unable to do magic or at the very least weakens them""

""I'm impressed. How exactly did you figure it out?""

""I"" he paused ""experimented on live subjects"".

She let out a slight, nervous laugther, ""you wouldn't bring a Dimerian to our safe haven"" she gave a puzzled look ""would you?""

He decided not to respond, an answer surely meant he would disclose information that was best kept secret, however he needed to say something before she jumped to conclusions
*is it me or did that rock grow in size?* he thought as he looked at it.

""Have you heard of Shoree?""

""That gifted Dimerian newborn? I heard the poor girl dissapp...."" she stopped,her face swiftly shifted to a horrified look.

*Damn it i said too much already* he thought, Talos would have slammed his palm against his forehead of frustration had he not shown restraint.



*is this truly the brother i knew a long time ago?* she wondered as he waved his arm around, as he spoke, he did not look her in the eyes.

"" A grown up would have alerted the authorites"" he said it with such a stale and emotionless voice, she almost believed he was talking seriously.

*since when did Tal start abducting children?* such thought felt so bitter she immediately dismissed it *i shouldn't hastily jump to conclusions, Tal wouldn't do that, he knows the pain of losing a daughter, surely he wouldn't inflict it on another*, **but he said it himself**, all the lively comfort of her brother's company had suddenly transformed into an unpleasant of air of uncertanty and distrust, **how unsurprising though, if he did it to frogs and birds in his childhood, what could have stopped him from switching to an Anthropoïd, Dimerian or Lantharr, it didn't matter, she was but a baby, a harmless being, one who didn't hit him with a spiked belt whenever he stopped working, who didn't lock him up in the ""meat seat"" whenever he was too tired to continue building, she hasn't mistreated any of us Lantharr unlike her evil kin**, *but they will make sure she uses her gifts to torment us*, **not if i help it**, *maybe we, I could raise her as my ow*-
""Do you have your flintlock?"" He interrupted her thought.
She unceremoniously dropped her bag on the flat surface then pulled out a polished wooden box, the name T.K was burned on the lid, but before she handed it to him, she asked ""what do you mean to do with it?""

""I mistrust this Q'uben of yours ,the Sorkonim are known for scavenging and disassembling machinery, not building it""

""I repaired it myself""

""All the more reason to inspect it"" he said so fast she wondered if he predicted her answer, *why does he spend so much effort analysing me, he's the one acting suspicious* she thought, puzzled.

She frowned and handed him the container, he pulled the lid off and slid the box on it, it fit perfectly, *well that's something new* no wonder he knew the box bettr than her, *he* is the one who invented it.
The gun was laid on top of a clump of wet hay, though she didn't expect it to freeze, he had to pry the gun from the icy mess, he grabbed it by the walnut handle, the edge of the barrel was slightly bent outwards like a less exagerrated end of a French horn, the metal contraption was maginificently made, but rust had covered half of its surface, though it looked functional.

""Does this gunpowder ignite at sub-zero temperatures?"" 

*does the madlad plan on killing me?* ""No"" she lied to him.Talos shoved his hand in his pocket, and when he removed it, he was holding a piece of yellow tissue, with blackened parts and round black beads and clots stuck to it. He proceeded to clean the gun with it.

""There is a bullet jamming the chamber"" he let out a smal mocking laugh, "" you do know that bullets cannot be fired more than once"".

""Give me the girl"" she said firmly, a result of her rehearsing in her mind for minutes, ""I shall take care of her""

He did not move his eyes away from the weapon, ""Why should i?""

- ""I am your sister, you should know better than to voice your distrust in my motherly skills"", persuation was her weak spot, so naturally her heart beat faster out of stress, "" This poor girl deserves better than to live in a workshop with a man who probably awaits an opportunity to get rid of her"" it beat harder and harder, she felt the adenaline spilling in her body as the beats grew closer together ""how you must despise feeding her and getting her to sleep, probably more than that arm of yours, She will no longer be a burden to you""

""She isn't""

""But you'll spend more time researching and less time cleaning diapers"" *good job, it seems the communication lessons i had years ago are finally paying off*

""No i won't"" his eyes were still stuck to the stupid contraption, *how did that not break him*

""The real question should be why shouldn't you?""

959,Fantasy,The difficulty of Malazan is very overhyped IMO,"So I started Malazan Book of the Fallen about a month ago and just finished book 2 yesterday so yes I know I’m not even close to done but so far I’d say most of the scaremongering I’ve seen on here and on booktube has been mostly unwarranted. The series has been made out by some to be this unconquerable task that all but the most experienced of fantasy readers will find incomprehensible, and believe me I’m not an experienced fantasy reader by any definition (before this I’d read First Law, Witcher and The Broken Empire).

Now don’t get me wrong, the series isn’t easy and the scope is unparalleled imo and if that’s something you don’t like then yes maybe it’s not for you but i honestly believe that if you go into it accepting that you will not understand everything and that Erickson will not hold your hand at all then you should be ok, it’s by no means easy but it’s nowhere near as difficult of a read as some make it out to be in my honest opinion.

I’d love to hear others opinions of this, if you’ve read or are reading it how did you find it?"
960,Fantasy,"Looking for different, entirely character-driven high fantasy books","I love the concept of high-fantasy, with other worlds and magic and the freedom it gives, but I can't get into high-fantasy books because there's too much going on. Characters trying to save the world, or dozens of people with similar names getting into political drama, I don't have the patience. I tried Tolkien, Brandon Sanderson, tried other literary fantasy recs (but its not the prose that bothers me) I didn't get past 100 pages of Name of the Wind, but read Slow Regard... in two sittings. I enjoyed some of disc-world ideas, but didn't click with Pratchett's writing unfortunately (might give another try tho).
I need ""fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" or ""a scanner darkly"" as high-fantasy; something small, low-stakes, 100% character driven. Any takes?"
961,Fantasy,"It just seems like there is large untapped potential in Bronze Age based Fantasy for animes, shows and games","It just seems people haven't figured out how it would work. The 'big civilizations' would be Myceneans, Egypt, the Celts, Mesopotamian states, Hittites and Warring States China. The sword shapes from that period look quite interesting enough for use in fantasy, and they aren't well known aside from the Khopesh.

The fact most soldiers and people who fought besides the ones considered important or wealthy didn't really wear much armor at all (Due to how expensive it is) leaves artists or writers to have more freedom in making up what characters can wear without contradicting the history all that much.

Are there any writers or artists taking a look at the Bronze Age for something yet? 

Its kind of like how in modern fiction 'World War 1' themed stuff doesn't get much love despite WWII, 21st century and Cold War themed stuff getting it all."
962,Fantasy,"I really liked The Gutter Prayer, Bas-Lag Trilogy, The Half-Made World, City Of Stairs and the Books of Babel. What else can you recommend me?","Sorry about the long title! I went on /r/suggestmeabook, and a commenter suggested instead I come here. Really like that kind of steampunky city type feel. What should I read next?"
963,Fantasy,Recommend: adventure without moralizing,"I want to read a fantasy novel or series that has a lot of adventure in an interesting and well developed world. I also hope it has no good and evil, and indeed not much of a moral stand taken by the author on anything.

If possible something without melodramatic scenes of any kind, without corny dialogs, and generally well written. But then maybe I'm already asking for too many things :)

Any recommendations appreciated!"

968,Fantasy,Johanes Cabal: The Necromancer - Book Review," 

**‘Johannes Cabal: The Necromancer’ is a witty and amusing novel with an intriguing premise; What if a necromancer ran a soul stealing carnival to win a bet with Satan?**

The prose in this novel where enjoyably humorous, full of wordplay and absurd similes. Fans of ‘Bad Omens’ and other Terry Pratchett works are likely to find something they enjoy here. While the humor didn’t land as well as Sir Terry’s, for me at least, I know that’s a pretty tall order. There were, however, a number of amusing observations and situations that brought a smile to my face, or a chuckle here and there.

The chapters play out as episodic situations. Johanes‘s carnival train goes from town to town where he tries with varying degrees of success to swindle people out of their souls. In general, these segments didn’t build on each other very well and didn’t mount the tension or the stakes of the story, but most of them were entertaining and interesting. The plot is pretty straightforward: Johanes has to steal enough souls to win a bet with the Devil or he loses his soul. This premise does create a few problems for the story. What Johanes is doing is inherently unlikable. He is a bad guy stealing souls. While eventually the narrative starts to work to undermine this bad guy caricature with humanizing emotions, that particular train leaves the station a bit tardy.

In fact, I think characterization in this novel was a little weak in general. There are really only three characters that have any sort of depth at all, and most of that comes in the third act. For the first 2/3 of the book, it’s pretty tough to get invested emotionally. Which isn’t as bad as it might seem at first blush. This book mostly banks on novelty, wit, and humor. On a superficial level you’re rooting for Johanes to beat the devil, but emotionally, if he doesn’t win you don’t care. After all, he’s a soul stealing, devil summoning, murdering necromancer. This sort of takes the wind out of the plot’s sails. On the one hand, the story is interesting and funny, but it never quite grabs hold of you and takes you for a ride. The author also withholds Johanes‘s motivation for getting into all of this in the first place until the end of the book, which was a factor that might’ve triggered more engagement with the main character had it been established earlier in the novel. It’s kind of like a Checkov’s Gun misfire, the motivation is pretty obviously foreshadowed, so it isn’t a surprise, but by the time the story presents it to the reader, its moment has passed.

What the novel really does well is imagine a unique world where the devil and his embarrassingly foolish minions go toe-to-toe with a brilliant necromancer for a laugh. The carnies, the undead, the devils, and the rubes all mixed together into a delightful world that feels coherent and entertaining. This is why I specifically compared it to Bad Omens. The two works felt pretty similar in tone and had some overlap in subject matter. Bad Omens is a little sillier and a little more polished, but if you loved it, this might be worth a read too.

All-in-all, I’d say this was an enjoyable novel that had a few things that I loved and a few things I didn’t. Clever wordplay and good world building tipped the scales of judgment from a three to a four-star read despite characterization and plot that were a little on the weak side. I’d recommend it to fans of humorous fantasy looking for a short read and an impish cackle or two."

970,Fantasy,"Bingo mini-reviews: Eye Of Obscurance, A Song of Wraiths and Ruin, and other highlights","I told myself at the start of bingo that I’d do hero mode and review every book I read for bingo. That didn’t happen, but I’m determined to review at least a couple. So here are my attempts at mini-reviews for **Eye of Obscurance** and **A Song of Wraiths and Ruin**, plus super teeny commentary on a few other highlights.

—

**Eye of Obscurance** by Jeffrey L. Kohanek (self-published) 
The author kindly gifted this book to me as a prize for completing last year's bingo, which I'm super grateful for. Especially since it was *exactly* the kind of light-hearted fantasy I needed in April 2020. 

Eye of Obscurance is a light, easy-to-read medieval fantasy. It's a great, interesting bit of escapism if you need a break from the real world (and who doesn’t?). Sadly I didn’t take good enough notes at the time to do a full review, but the worldbuilding had some super interesting aspects I very much liked, and the characters had some fun clever moments. There were times when I felt like the tension was a bit low, but overall I enjoyed it. The worldbuilding and plot setup made me curious enough I might have to get over my Kindle aversion (Kobo all the way!) to read the rest of this series!

So thank you, u/JLKohanek , for making COVID panic a little more bearable.


**A Song of Wraiths and Ruin** by Roseanne A. Brown (book club)
I really enjoyed this book - it was well-written, and my personal notes on it were a lot of all caps screaming about mental health and Malik’s character arc.

This book briefly touches on self-harm and self-harm ideation - nothing graphic - and it does this with such care for the character and the reader, in a way that felt genuine and that resolved with hope and warmth. As someone who used to self-harm, I felt seen and cared for after reading the one particular scene. That scene meant so much to me.
 
And I really enjoyed the book overall. The characters were driven and interesting, the plot was engaging, the worldbuilding was great. It was much lighter on romance than I expected, but that was fine by me. My biggest complaint is that “Wraiths” is too hard to say and throws off the rhythm of the title lol.


**Other Bingo highlights**

* A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine (epigraphs): I think I submitted a Malazan book for this square but this book counts too, and it’s now one of my fave books. The politics! The culture! The naming conventions! So good.
* Sleeping Giants by Sylvain Neuvel (big dumb object): Been meaning to read this for forever, finally read it because of bingo, and I loved it. The author pulls off the report/interview format so so well. Also, very jealous of his name.
* Moon of the Crusted Snow by Waubgeshig Rice (features ice/snow/cold): So reading this during lockdown anxiety was a bad idea, because the apocalypse aspect felt chillingly realistic. Really grateful for the Indigenous perspective, felt like it broadened my own worldview.
* Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (made me laugh): This was my one reread. I was obsessed with this series as a kid, and I’m glad to report that it still holds up as a fun, hilarious story. No I did not see the movie, just hearing about it was depressing enough.

Thanks to everyone who runs bingo and to all those who suggest books that fit the different categories! I definitely read some books this year I wouldn’t have if not for bingo."
971,Fantasy,I love descriptions of food in fantasy novels. What’s your favourite food scene?,"Game of Thrones has tons of detailed ones, but one of my favourites for some reason is a simple passage from The Eye of the World:

Master Fitch: “I’m afraid the food isn’t what it should be, either. Just the chickens and some turnips and henpeas, and some cheese for after. I truly do apologize.”

Moraine: “For these troubled times, a feast indeed.”"
972,Fantasy,"Streak 107: WhatsApp, Telegram, y Signal",[deleted]
973,Fantasy,"I want to love fantasy, but I’m honestly almost never emotionally invested in any fantasy sorry I read.","I’ve read a decent sampling of fantasy. Book one of Riyria, WoT, and Assassins Apprentice, MST, Shannara. Then both Kings of the Wyld and Bloody Rose, all of the Prydain series and Magician:Apprentice.

All in all I’ve rarely felt that sense of wonder and emotional attachment. That’s not to say they were entertaining or bad books. I just never truly felt those moments that were supposed to be a WOW. I think Prydain and Assassins Apprentice came closest. Both very immersive. But I’ve finished Prydain and while I do plan on going back to Hobb, I am currently in the mood for more mythical beasts, magic, and adventure. 

So I’m still looking for that book that grabs you and doesn’t let go. The book that has character development toward cool and unexpected places. The sense of wonder you had of seeing Luke learn about the force or Indy open the ark. I’m looking for a book that has you so emotionally invested in the adventure that the WOW moments really matter. 

Now again, the problem is probably more my fault than these books. These are beloved books obviously. But what would you recommend for someone seeking what I am. Keep in mind I’m not big into a lot of large military battles or political scheming. And I do like to have a few mythical beasts in my fantasy. But what series for you captured that feeling best? Those hit you in the gut shocking turns. Seeing characters change in varying ways. Truly caring for them. Immersive cozy writing. And of course just some badass moments of adventure and survival and truly heartbreaking deaths?"

[My Visual Bingo Card](https://i.postimg.cc/SSKFTMvH/Fantasy-Book-Bingo-2020.png)


**Personal rules**:   
The books on my card are mostly books that I really liked, and some that I only kind of liked.    

1. Translated: “A Winter’s Promise” Christelle Dabos.  I’m cultured now, I read translated French works ooh la la.  

1. Snow, Ice, or Cold: “A Time of Dread” John Gwynne.  This was the first of 5 different books by 5 different authors I read this year where the cover art is a big giant sword hilt (this one’s on fire though so extra style points) (I also considered making a penis-substitute joke here).  

1. Optimistic: “Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle” Inverarity.  This is LITERAL HARRY POTTER FANFIC, I can feel you judging me from here and I don’t care, this was very well-done.  

1. Necromancy: “The Unspoken Name” A.K. Larkwood.  This one was not at all what I expected based on the plot description, but still a positive experience.  

1. Ace/Aro: “Dread Nation” Justina Ireland.  This is a book about slavery and zombie-fighting that is surprisingly not reminiscent of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter whatsoever.  

1. Ghost: “Charming” Elliot James.  Blah blah Dresden Files blah blah urban fantasy YOU’RE JUDGING ME AGAIN don’t care this was a fun read.  

1. Exploration: “Dungeon Crawler Carl” Matt Dinniman.  I really, really, inexplicably like this ongoing web serial lit-RPG, I just really actually like it and look forward to reading it every week.  

1. Climate Fiction: “Death March” Phil Tucker.  This is your more run-of-the-mill lit-RPG, but the only other climate fiction book I read was a morbidly depressing thing where pretty much everyone did mean shit, so between the two give me heroic lit-RPG any day.
  
1. Color in the Title: “My Life as a White Trash Zombie” Diana Rowland.  ⅗ for plot and writing, 5/5 for title and cover art.  

1. r/Fantasy Book Club: “The Bone Ships” R.J. Barker.  If you wanted to know about this book you should have done the book club.  

1. Self-Published: “Priest” Matthew Colville.  I am still just completely maddened by the incredible stupidity and stubbornness of the knights that the priest investigates.

1. Chapter Epigraphs: “City of Lies” Sam Hawke. The author is an Australian who has a black belt in Japanese jiu jitsu and trains in Brazilian jiu jitsu and writes good fantasy books, so I would like for her to be a playable character in a video game, please.  

1. Published in 2020: “Tuyo” Rachel Neumeier.  Wins for the most sexual tension between two straight male characters.  

1. School or University: “Wundersmith: The Calling of Morrigan Crow” Jessica Townsend.  I am just in love with the giant talking cat &gt;!MMA fighter!&lt; character.  

1. Book about Books: “The Dragon’s Path” Daniel Abraham. Someone please tell me if I can read the sequel, because I’m scared that this is one of those things where all the main characters slowly become corrupted and evil.  

1. Made you Laugh: “Generation V” M.L. Brennan.  I adore this series because it’s genuinely funny and because despite being a teenage vampire, the main character is refreshingly un-mopey.  

1. Short Stories: “Envy of Angels” Matt Wallace. It’s a novella, sue me, I don’t like short stories (only putting my fave of the 5 I read down otherwise this review would be more than one line and I couldn’t live with the inconsistency).  

1. Big Dumb Object: “The Gutter Prayer” Gareth Hanrahan.  Objectively this is a well-written and innovative fantasy book; subjectively it makes me depressed because I am shallow.  

1. Feminist: “In Other Lands” Sarah Rees Brennan.  I laughed, I groaned, I said “enough with the love triangles please for the love of god” but I kept reading because it’s just so funny.  

1. Canadian Author: “The Initiate Brother” Sean Russell.  Everyone is excruciatingly polite to one another even when they are murdering each other (side note in my head this book is forever linked to brownies because I ate an entire pan of them in two days while reading it).  

1. Number in the Title: “The Seventh Bride” T. Kingfisher.  I am on the fence about this as my Number bingo card choice, versus Street Cultivation 2 (yes, that is ANOTHER lit-RPG book, really you need a hobby besides judging people and anyway I didn’t do it, I went with the classic fairytale re-telling).  

1. Romance: “Dreamer’s Pool” Juliet Marillier.  Despite the pretty romantic fantasy cover art, the opening chapters of this book are hardcore gritty grimdark, fair warning.

1. Magical Pet: “Darkening Skies” Eden Hudson.  Quite enjoyed this one, but felt the sequel was a let-down and DNF’d it.  

1. Graphic/Audio novel: “Tellurion” Matt Rhodes (you can read for free on his website).  Fantasy webcoming WITH NO WORDS so 25% of the time I had no idea why things were happening but it sure was pretty to look at.  

1. Politics: “Heroes Die” Matthew Stover.  When you want to fight magical baddies with your sword, but you also wanna stick it to the man in a futuristic dystopia, and are just hankering for some 90’s fantasy cover art.

&amp;nbsp;


*Clearly there was some liberal overuse of parentheses commas and semicolons in order to keep all these reviews at one line.*

**Read**: 107 books  

**DNF’d**: an additional 30 books, some of which I didn’t throw down in disgust till I was over halfway through the book.  I’m bitter about this and I want my wasted time back.   

 
**Bingo format**: organic.  I read what I wanted to and hoped all my squares would get filled in.  The only exception was the graphic novel, had to seek that one out.

975,Fantasy,Can’t remember title of this portal fantasy,"Hey everyone!

I read a book around 2004-2006ish. Sold at Barnes and Noble. Setting was in medieval-type human civilization. There’s this golden-hour type plot where, in the woods, if you go there during a certain part of the day, you’d be transported to this... fantasy/magic kind of society. Like... elf kinda people/perfect appearance/smell/whatever. 

So.. I think her mother disappeared going after that world or something... her dad forbade her from nearing that area.. doesn’t go too much into that in the beginning, but basically the first issue is that her father is missing and she is looking for him.

It’s been forever since I’ve read this, so some of these details may be incorrect. But, for sure, the plot is a young woman looking for her dad who disappeared. She enters this other world she was forbidden to pursue, is looked as a grimy creature because humans are like beneath these magical folk...."
976,Fantasy,Looking for feedback on whether some books are trigger-free when it comes to female characters,"It's a bit difficult to explain what I'm after but here goes.

For the past several months I have been in a very bad mental place, trying to cope with past trauma caused by men. So I tried reading as a way to distract myself. As my luck would have it, all of the books I picked up this year have been very triggering. Here's the examples:

* China Mievile - Perdido Street Station: &gt;!the entire plot of the book is based around a rapist seeking to avoid punishment, and the events that ensue as a result. It also features very disturbing sections with graphic descriptions of harm being done to women.!&lt;
* Michael Moorcock - Gloriana: &gt;!the story of a rape survivor who is unable to achieve an orgasm, but somehow manages to do so when the man she loves tries to rape her.!&lt;
* Jack Vance - Tales of the Dying Earth: &gt;!almost all women are portrayed as playthings for men. Even if they are strong and resilient at first, they lose all agency and become lifeless puppets once the male protagonist comes into contact with them. Often, they are either offered to other characters as sexual toys, or are left for dead once the protagonist has had their way with them. Had to drop the book halfway through.!&lt;
* Steven King - The Dark Tower: &gt;!all the women are needlessly sexualized, with borderline sentient breasts. They are only good for sex, and they become a clingy nuisance once the deed is done.!&lt;

Admittedly, I maybe should have read up on them beforehand, but I honestly did not expect **all** of them to be bad. Again, it's just my luck.

Now, I don't have an eBook reader, and it will take some time until any new books I order get delivered. I have the following books in paperback format and, if anyone has read them, I'm hoping you can tell me if they're safe enough to read. I don't mind spoilers, but feel free to hide them for those who haven't read them yet.

* Elizabeth Moon - Sheepfarmer's Daughter
* Brian McNaughton - The Throne of Bones
* Jack Vance - Lyonesse
* Sergei Lukyanenko - Night Watch
* Ada Palmer - Too Like the Lightning

I'm not asking for much from these books, just that they don't portray women in any demeaning or dehumanizing way. Also, I understand that in literature you need hardship and adversity to build strong characters, but how you do this also counts. And right now, I am not in a good mental place to read about any form of abuse towards women (especially sexual abuse). 

Also, if you have other recommendations of books I might like, write them down and I'll try to order them when I get the chance.

Thank you all :)"

It left me feeling absolutely nothing towards the characters or the world and least of all the plot. I only got two chapters into the first book of the series that was meant to be a follow-up before I was able admit to myself that I wasn’t enjoying it at all.

984,Fantasy,Areas corrupted by magic and/or aliens,"I just read *The Hollow Places* by T. Kingfisher, which is inspired by the classic horror story *The Willows* by Algernon Blackwood (Lovecraft's favorite story), and it reminded me of a trope I enjoy: an area of the world that has been somehow corrupted, or made mysterious by the presence of dark magic or aliens. An area which is clearly delineated from conventional reality by some twisted, strange presence.

Some examples:

* Area X in *Annihilation* by Jeff VanderMeer.
* The Woods in *Uprooted* by Naomi Novik.
* The Zone in *Stalker*.
* Whatever the fuck is going on onboard the *Event Horizon* in the film of the same name.
* The Misery in Ed McDonald's *Raven's Mark* series (which is basically the result of a magical nuke).
* The space station in *Solaris*.
* An area of the Danube river in *The Willows*, ""on the frontier of another world, an alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of willows.""

Do you enjoy this trope? Do you have any good examples I missed?"

986,Fantasy,About the upcoming Apple+’s Foundation TV show,"As a fan of Asimov’s original story, a social sci fi work set thousands of years in the future and covering 500 years into a visionary scientist’s project to rebuild a galactic human civilization after its downfall, I am very worried that the show won’t be true at all to the original story.

No, I’m not talking about petty things like “gender bending” of particular characters (I couldn’t care less about it) or other small or irrelevant changes (Dornick’s home world for instance). I’ve seen discussion about it but IMHO it misses the point.

The point being it being changed from an ambitious, sociological, centuries spanning story focused on the fictional science of psychohistory to a soap opera style, character and interpersonal relashionship-driven, full of allegories for current, real life talking points kind of show like literally everything else labeled sci-fi in television these days.

Am I right to worry about it? Or can the story survive and thrive even if just a worldbuilding setting for a more conventional TV show?"

988,Fantasy,Do you prefer LOTS of descriptions or VERY LITTLE?,"I saw another post on here about readers with Aphantasia, or an inability to visualize mental images. I've found that I tend to have a hard time visualizing things as well as I read (and write), though the more vivid scenes still spark images in my mind.

But right now I'm listening to David Gemmell's Waylander novels and reading a sci-fi novel (upcoming by Aethon Books), and I notice how trimmed down their descriptions are. Same with Pierce Brown's Red Rising and a lot of the other books I really enjoyed. It's the characterizations and dialogue that really sinks home to me, and it's what I focus on when I write because that's what really is important to me.

However, I know a lot of readers LOVE the really ornate and detailed descriptions in a lot of fantasy books. They have much more active imaginations than I do, and they can visualize everything clearly. 

So what kind of reader are you?

**A) Like me, fairly limited to the words on the page. If so, which series have you enjoyed most that keep things moving with minimal descriptions?**

or

**B) Actively imaginative and seeing everything as written. If so, which series give you that glorious, beautiful prose and descriptions?**"

992,Fantasy,What are some of your favourite substance-based magic systems and why?,"The ones that come to mind for me are Allomancy from *Mistborn* which is pretty much the definitive these days, but my personal favourite is Jade from the Greenbone saga. It pretty much gives you normal enhancements but also a few benefits like deflection (telekinesis pretty much), steeling and a few other bits and bobs that just make it cool. the best thing about it though is how it affects the economy, with a lot of time being spent on the black market, the duels fought over Jade and the addiction it can give you that will either kill you or leave you obsessed with finding more. AND it only works for certain people and others have to use drugs to keep up with it. Pretty cool."

I was suggested to try the Thongor series, it being firmly (if very pulpy/campy) sword and sorcery, but I notice one of the covers has a spaceship on it, which has me worried.

I have nothing against people who like ""sword and planet,"" but personally the sci-fi element really brings me out of the story.  So, does anyone know if there's a lot of technology and spaceships and whatnot?  Thanks in advance.

(yes, I know going in that Thongor is super campy and tropey - that doesn't bother me at all)"

## 26th March – Aofie’s Quest (Gods &amp;Goddesses of Labraid #1) by Angela J. Ford

*A warrior princess with a dire future embarks on a perilous quest to regain her fallen kingdom.*

*Eighteen-year-old Aofie’s Mor is an outcast princess, hiding in the sacred forest of the centaurs. She’s spent her life training for one purpose: to take back her kingdom from the angel of death.*

*When she comes of age, the centaurs prepare her to reunite with the humans. However, on the morning of her departure, she learns a horrific truth that leaves her questioning her true identity.*

*Frustrated, but taught not to question the will of the gods, Aofie travels deep into perilous lands in search of her birth mother. Along the way she accidentally frees a dangerous goddess, befriends a mysterious iceman, and meets a magic-wielding nymph.*

*But threads of betrayal and corruption run deeper than Aofie imagined. As she faces trials and tribulations, she begins to question everything she’s assumed to be true. Caught in the ultimate war between good and evil, Aofie must make a choice about her future.*

*Will she have the strength and courage to take back her kingdom? Or will she turn her back on fate and choose her own destiny?*

## 26th March – The Last Days of Earth by Andrew Hindle 

*Not lightly does one kill a God. There is always a price to pay. There is always an equal and opposite reaction, whether you speak of the most basic principles of physics or stalk the lofty halls of deicide leaving footprints of ichor. And so it was with Earth, which gasped its last in the estimated Eleventh Century after the Fall; called the 1322nd year ExE by the elders; called 3700 AD by the truly ancient.*

*And the last remnants of humanity, those left behind, those who had deserted the sinking ship, all came away from it with their own stories. These stories formed the tapestry that was to become known as the Wild Empire of humankind.*

*All of these groups were mostly wrong, and they all spent most of their time trying to kill each other anyway.*

*This story is the true account of the Last Days of Earth, and the culmination of events set in motion in Bad Cow and Greyblade.*

*To stave off impending doom, misfit heroes embark on a quest for magical sword not seen in millennia.*

*The newborn princess of Pallanar is abducted, triggering a desperate search. Her wizard father will do anything to rescue her. Who is behind it and what will his efforts cost?*

*Toppled thrones send two wizardoms into chaos. The ambitious strive to claim power while new gods rise to replace the old. What can it all mean?*

## 1st April – The Conjuring of Zoth-Avarex: The Self-Proclaimed Greatest Dragon in the Multiverse by K.R.R. Lockhaven 

*Kept hidden by the United States government for decades, the Site is a place where magic is real. But that doesn’t mean that everything happening there is sparkly. Soul-sucking policies and layers of stifling bureaucracy threaten to take all the fun out of magic.*

*Harris, a newbie Conjurer, starts his first day of work at the Site bursting with excitement: he’s been brought on for an extremely big project happening the very next day. In a triumph over its habitual inefficiency, the Site manages to carry out its plan and conjure an actual dragon to be used by the military.*

*The dragon (Zoth-Avarex, the self-proclaimed greatest dragon in the multiverse) immediately eats the person next to him, snatches a “princess” from the ranks of the Conjuring Department, and flies away to the Space Needle. There he manipulates the media, outwits the Site’s bumbling management, demands sixty-three billion dollars’ worth of treasure (because Smaug was said to have had sixty-two billion in his hoard), threatens to destroy the city—and installs a couple of food trucks.*

The treacherous spellcaster Alsayer fled there, along with Kallie Fedgley, but finding them without attracting the murderous gaze of the prince might be impossible.*

## 9th April – Chaos Rising (The Nine World Chronicles #2) by Lyra Wolf 

*Let’s start Ragnarok, they said. It’ll be fun, they said.*

*When the chance to start Ragnarok presents itself, Loki feels the apocalypse is as good a way as any to burn Asgard to the ground. And, it is, until the gods reveal their own teensy, tiny little surprise for Loki.*  


*Suddenly, Loki has every reason in the worlds to stop them from ending. But this is Ragnarok, and one does not simply stop the apocalypse.*

## 9th April – Dances of Deception RE-RELEASE (The Dragon Songs Saga #3) by J.C. Kang 

*The world knows Kaiya as the Dragon Charmer.*

*After vanquishing the Last Dragon with the power of her voice, all she wants is to return to a quiet life of anonymity.

*The mission reunites her with her childhood friend Tian, now an assassin-spy who loathes killing. He is no longer the adorable, gullible boy from her memories, any more than she is the adventurous, sweet girl from his. Instead of rekindling nostalgia for a youthful innocence they both yearn for, their reunion ignites a mutual hatred.*

*When the Teleri Empire breaks off negotiations, Tian must help Kaiya escape. Orcs, Ogres, and enemy soldiers stand between them and home, and their volatile relationship could get them captured… or killed.*

She and her Syraeic companions have but one duty: to track down those pretenders and end their reign of cruelty and lies, no matter the cost. To that end, the magical blade—mighty, single-minded Szaa’da’shaela—won’t allow any wavering of their commitment.*

*But the empire is in turmoil with the sudden passing of its undying queen. Noble houses clash and threaten civil war, murderous barbarians mass on the frontier in preparation for a bloody invasion, and all feel the aching void left by the clergy, whose temples were devastated by a great fire.

995,Fantasy,Reviews and Doodles: Bingo Wrap-Up Row 4!,"Hi everyone! Since you all said I was too self deprecating last time with my reviews and bad fan art, I'm changing the name to reviews and doodles :) Without further ado, here are my mini-reviews for row 4 of bingo!

&amp;#x200B;

[I love how the cover art for this row looks so nice together](https://preview.redd.it/pfidyhlvfzp61.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25fed2a51b308040a02a00cf47d9886a4e34f603)

## A Book that Made you Laugh

### In Other Lands by Sarah Rees Brennan

&amp;#x200B;

[Modern technology bursts into flames in the fantasy realm, even old-school ipods](https://preview.redd.it/bx86otp0gzp61.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b8557e6855b5c4f7b481ab8dd3a7f4a81fd516f)

**Hard Mode**: Yes!

This was an early contender for one of my top reads of 2020. This  portal fantasy reminded me of a less-angsty version of the Magicians,  partially a parody of the entire portal fantasy and magic school genres,  but with a whole lot of heart. Although there are a lot of parody and  satire elements, I never got the impression that the narrative doesn’t  take itself seriously. My heart broke for the main character on several  occasions, and I cheered just as strongly for his triumphs. The main  character starts out as an insufferable obnoxious pain in the arse, but  as a reader I loved reading about him anyway and enjoyed seeing his  growth. There is excellent gay and bisexual rep in this book. I  particularly enjoyed the scathing critique of traditional gender roles.  In the fantasy world, elves have the direct opposite gender roles as we  have in our society, with women being the traditional warriors and  hunters, while men stay home with the children. This division is  ridiculous in their society, and as such, highlights how it’s ridiculous  in ours. 

### Other Bingo Squares

* Novel set in a school or university
* Romantic Fantasy

## Five (or more!) Short Stories

### The Book of Dragons, ed. Jonathan Strahan 

&amp;#x200B;

[A western and an eastern dragon](https://preview.redd.it/4638tlu4gzp61.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf3db4722e1a3eb531e63a33e26cfb79411bb5c0)

**Hard Mode**: Yes! I read the entire anthology!

I always have to preface this square with the disclaimer that I am  not really a short story person, and therefore often think I’m the wrong  person to review these kinds of works. A lot of the time, I find they  end just as I was starting to enjoy them. I also think I have this  unfair stereotype that short stories are always navel-gazey and  depressing, which I don’t think is really the case, especially not with  the short stories in this collection. So with all that out of the way, I  found the stories in this collection to be a delight all around! I  really love stories with dragons in them in general, and all the  different ways people came up with to tell stories about dragons was  really fun to read. There were dragons who fall in love with humans,  dragons who must learn about family loyalty and responsibility, and  dragons who power the energy of the entire world. My personal favorite  was The Long Walk by Kate Elliot, which was a wonderful feminist story  that, while I would have loved to see it extended to a full novel,  remained perfectly satisfying at the length it was. I think reading this  anthology has taught me that I should really give short stories more of  a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

## Big Dumb Object

### Flight of the Darkstar Dragon by Benedict Patrick

&amp;#x200B;

[A little dumb object, this magic game piece may be the key to salvation. But DO NOT try to steal it!](https://preview.redd.it/488u63t8gzp61.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86523e0726bfa403d98c85f22b31f764ab7b7dee)

**Hard Mode:** Probably not

I admit that I had some amount of trouble with this square because it  was difficult to tell what counted or didn’t. I heard Annihilation and  Ringworld tossed around a lot as examples, but I found it difficult to  get into the former and outright detested the latter. Eventually however  I settled on Flight of the Darkstar Dragon, wherein an airship crew  finds themselves stranded in an inter-dimensional nexus inhabited by one  very large and very angry dragon. I know monsters do not count as the  big dumb object, but I am counting the inter-dimensional portal system  itself, not the dragon, so, uh, hope the Bingo cops don’t arrest me.  Anyway, this book was unique and entertaining and a lot of fun. I loved  the characters and their struggles, and the sense of wonder and  exploration as they try to figure out this ridiculous situation they’ve  found themselves in. The different dimensions they travel to are  interesting, but the darkstar dimension is perhaps the most compelling  of all, with lots of vivid descriptions of magical and mystical things. I  hope Mr. Patrick decides to write more in this universe. Multiverse?

### The Midnight Bargain by C.L. Polk

&amp;#x200B;

[A pretty collar with a terrible purpose](https://preview.redd.it/67i1p7nlgzp61.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acfb33598116043d176ecedbdb6da13fea453bc4)

**Hard Mode:** Yes

This one definitely falls in my top 5 best reads of 2020. Imagine the  Netflix adaptation of Bridgerton, but with magic and demons and  characters who are significantly less insufferable, and you will have  The Midnight Bargain. Beatrice was a wonderful character, deeply dutiful  and loyal to her family (even though her father in particular doesn’t  seem to much deserve it) but also with hopes and dreams and ambitions of  her own, and a perhaps naive longing to serve both at once. My favorite  character was probably the demon/spirit she ends up bonding with. Make  no mistake, demons in this world are capable of causing plenty of  trouble, but they are not malevolent as much as lacking in impulse  control. The creature’s childlike enthusiasm for the human world was  delightful to read about. The feminist aspect of this novel displays a  deeply unfair patriarchal system that punishes women for their ability  to rear children. People who use magic while pregnant may end up  unwittingly having their children taken over by demons. Because of this,  married women are forbidden from using magic, by binding them in a  collar that is truly nightmarish to wear. This book kept me tense and on  the edge of my seat the whole time, and I ended up reading through it  quickly as a result.

### The Wolf of Oren-Yaro by K.S. Villoso

&amp;#x200B;

[A creepy little dragonfly pin, a courting gift for the main character from a creepy little prince](https://preview.redd.it/9ytr5inpgzp61.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f23fc9ea33f0b8dbfe15f78f6473d0944a023be)

**Hard Mode:** I mean, it was, technically, the first time I read it, but not anymore

I first read the Wolf of Oren Yaro when it was  self-published in 2018, so I am using my one allowed reread for this  square. However, this is the first time I have read the version  published by Orbit. The Wolf of Oren-Yaro is a tightly paced and intense  story about what happens to a queen when she is stripped of all the  trappings of royal power and forced to survive on her own. My favorite  part of this book the raw emotional power of it, how Villoso makes us  all feel everything Talyien is feeling. The characters are all  beautifully, wonderfully human. They are messy, they make mistakes and  bad decisions, they cause me, the reader, to tear my hair out in  frustration. Tali, I want to scream, you are a badass Strong Independent  Woman, why oh why are you so hung up on a man who clearly does not  deserve you? But I think the fact that these characters are all so human  is what makes them so compelling to read about. I love these characters  and want them to succeed, even as they continue making bigger and  bigger messes for themselves.

996,Fantasy,Middle-Earth Universe Entry Point,"I am someone who has only read *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. I really loved these books but not so much that I would say I could dive head-first into anything Middle-Earth and automatically love it. However, I really would like to read more. 

With that in mind, what are the books that someone like me should definitely read (all of them? None of them? All but a couple?)? And also what order should they be read? Does it matter?

Thanks for the help :)"
997,Fantasy,What makes Brandon Sanderson such a polarising Author?,"Hey fellow readers

A few months ago (or weeks idk it's hard to judge how much time has passed in this crazy world) I made a post about how a friend of mine asked if Sanderson is a  good starting point and what his strengths are. Anyway it ended up being a very divisive post where the mods even had to delete some comments.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings to my question what makes Brandon such a polarising author that so many people shit on him when they have a chance or praise him to the sky. Personally he is just not really for me, I thought Mistborn was okay and Words of Radiance by far the best Stormlight book. Which brought me to the conclusion that I like the smaller scale Brandon books a lot better (especially after Oathbringer, which in my opinion had some big pacing issues and dragged a lot, which usually doesn't bother me when books are slow I just sometimes feel Brandon gets very repetitive with his words and scenes in these huge books. I don't know if he changed editors but anyway). I can respect his grind tho, and knowing that I can start his series without having to be scared that it won't be finished.

Please discuss and be nice to each other :)"
998,Fantasy,Too much of a good thing. How much fantasy is too much for readers?,"The genre of fantasy traces much of its roots to Earthen mythology. In mythology we see magic, otherworldly powers, higher powers, monsters, and strange creatures influence Earth and it's inhabitants. These same elements are often seen as the ""fantastical"" elements of fantasy that differentiate our stories from the seemingly mundane reality we find ourselves in. Unlike in mythology however, many of our modern fantasies do not take place on Earth. Yet they tend to have strikingly Earth-like qualities, though this is less true in regards to Sci-fi. There are humans and horses, birds and trees. Time is measured in months and hours. Familiar measurement systems are often used. All of this and more begs the question. Why? 

Would not a different world, developing and existing under different circumstances, be very different from out own? Undoubtedly so! There is a crazy level of worldbuilding possibility in this regard but rarely do we see this taken to any sort of extreme. Time and time again we tend to see medieval fantasy (not that I have a problem with that). As fun of a thought experiment as it can be there are some very good reasons why we don't that I'd like to discuss here and get your feedback on. 

Our stories have impact when the reader feels immersed in the world and feels like they can relate to its characters and understand its problems. When we make the world too alien, the characters too dissimilar, and their collective problems a mental quagmire, the story really struggles. In a setting that is familiar to us, that we can picture in our heads given adequate description, we can find our minds drifting there. When we can empathize with a character and understand their problems and how they feel we feel like a person we know and not a collection of squiggly lines on a screen or piece of paper. If we're too caught up in wrapping our heads around the setting and its rules or its characters we lose our immersion, our suspension of disbelieve, and struggle more to get invested in what's going on in the story itself. The story being arguably the most important part of, you know, the story. Therefore, it is imperative that you give the audience something to relate to, something familiar enough to them that when you do give them a piece of otherworldly fantasy goodness that they can digest and integrate this bit into their understanding of the world you are creating. The trick real trick is figuring out how much of the familiar to give versus how much new information you want them to contend with. This is one of many reasons we love medieval fantasy so much. It's relatively familiar given our history but unfamiliar given the difference in time period and the addition of fantasy elements. As readers we've also grown used to it and if feels comfortable to us.

As an author you'll also find writing things with a lot of unfamiliarity to be very challenging. For ease of writing it's easier for authors to fall back on what they are most familiar with as well. To do otherwise may require research and potentially a lot of it. Research you may have to somehow convey to the audience down the line. 

Take these short snippets into consideration:

""A young gnome scours the old forest south of the village in search of a rare magical ingredient for their Auntie's stew tonight.""

""The Teltik traded its hard earned Nornsbar for a portion of Yttryr that would be required for the 14 ilios descent beneath The Drift."" 

The first is mostly familiar and easy to wrap your head around, especially to those who have been exposed to fantasy or mythology before but still contains fantastical elements. The second is very odd and unforthcoming. You end up asking ""what's a Teltik, Nornsbar, Yttryr, an ilios, or The Drift?"". Can all of these be eventually be explained in time? Perhaps. Does having to explain it detract from the readers ability to follow along with the story? It certainly can. But, these sorts of things may also pique the readers interest. Giving the reader a healthy amount of mystery nurtures curiosity. Still, the second example is probably too much. These are just one sentence examples that don't have the same impact you'd see across a full work like a novel, but I hope they provide some small amount of clarity. 

Ultimately it will be the readers eagerness to learn and the measure of their patience that will determine how far they are willing to go on the deep dive journey with you into fantasy parts unknown. While I think it is in the best interest for author's to flex their creativity muscles and make something entirely new I think you eventually have to strike some kind of balance or risk losing your reader. Maybe question whether adding a particular source of unfamiliarity has any inherent benefit to the story telling or feel that you're going for. If you find it to be a superfluous thing though perhaps fall back on a more relatable equivalent.

The overly familiar motifs, themes, and tropes in modern fantasy can make thinks feel very generic and ""samey"",  whereas a story that comes with it's own textbook to understand what is going on is probably too unfamiliar and daunting. Where do you you find a good balance? What elements do you feel are overused? What are some of your favorite examples of something you'd never seen before in Fantasy that ended up being awesome?"
999,Fantasy,I have a question about an edition of a C.S.Lewis book,"Probably about 40 years ago, I saw a book that caught my attention. It was in a Publix grocery store in a wire rack of religious books. The cover showed a variety of multicolored fantastical creatures romping around a rustic area. The title of the book had the name MacDonald in it. This made me think it had something to do with the fast food restaurant.

As an adult I now know this probably had something to do with George MacDonald and that the cover that captivated me was probably a depiction of the goblin livestock from The Princess and the Goblin.

Does anyone know what book this could be? I am pretty sure it was not  The *Princess and the Goblin* as that title would have stuck with me. I know C.S.Lewis wrote an autobiography of the author titled  *George MacDonald* , I think this might be it but I have not had much luck searching online for a cover of that book that matches the one I remember.

Anyone have any idea what edition of the book might be what I am looking for?"

# [Humans are Weird – Inanimate Objects](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S2VT2TC)

“Quilx’tch, can you aid me?”

Quilx’tch glanced over at his superior as he entered the room. The chief cultural anthropologist was crouched over the main data screen in their office. Quilx’tch balanced the vials in his manipulators and rotated uneasily.

“Can it wait a moment, Tca’kct?” he replied. “I need to place the sample from the Hellbats in the refrigerator.”

“Make sure you place them in the sample refrigerator,” Tca’kct reminded him sternly. “But yes, that will be acceptable.”

Quilx’tch rotated and hurried to put the nutrient samples in the racks of the refrigeration unit. He made sure their labels were clearly visible and scurried back to where Tca’kct was flicking various symbols across the visual display screen. Quilx’tch aligned his primary eyes with the screen and tilted his abdomen to the side thoughtfully.

“Is this one of those human word puzzles?” he asked.

Tca’kct let out a chitter of irritation and swept a primary manipulator across the control surface, realigning the letters in the orderly rows the humans preferred.

“Betty,” Quilx’tch read. “A common derivate of a human name, female, I believe.”

“Yes, yes,” Tca’kct said. “I am aware of that. However, the base command transport has no sex so far as I know.”

Quilx’tch let his secondary eyes take in the stressed commander. Had he been getting sufficient nutrients lately? In lieu of a proper field medic, it was Quilx’tch’s task to ensure the base crew maintained their health.

“Oh, swarm,” Tca’kct snapped his mandibles at Quilx’tch. “Do stop thinking so loudly. I am fine.”

“You know your inappropriate use of that term has the humans thinking we are telepathic,” Quilx’tch reprimanded him.

“I take zero responsibility for what humans think,” Tca’kct said. “Now this,” he waved at the offending female name, “this is exactly why Mechanic Steve has named the command transport Betty.”

Quilx’tch felt his joints loosen with relief. “Oh, yes, they do that,” he said. “The transports that drop off the humans are in fact listed by their ‘names’ rather than their identification numbers in the files for the foodstuffs.”

“I am aware, Quilx’tch,” Tca’kct said, rubbing the ridges over his eyes. “If you read the functional briefing on humans, it lists that facet of their behavior. It also lists that that only refers to ships of a certain mass.”

“I was not aware of that,” Quilx’tch said.

“But Mechanic Steve has named a wheeled vehicle far below the tonnage requirements Betty,” Tca’kct said.

“I assume you have tried simply asking him,” Quilx’tch said.

“He muttered something inaudible and walked away after I asked why he had given an inanimate object a name,” Tca’kct replied. “Since then, I have been operating under the assumption that it is some form of what the humans call an acronym.”

“Well,” Quilx’tch began to back slowly away, “I will get back to my nutrient analysis.”

“One day we will understand the humans,” Tca’kct muttered to himself as he bent back over the control panel. “One day.”

Quilx’tch made a mental note to check on Tca’kct’s nutrient intake. Sometimes odd behavior was explainable by poor diet. On another leg, sometimes it was just prolonged exposure to humans.

1020,scifi,Paradigm 2045: Trinity's Children wins AudiobookReviewer.com's Best Sci-Fi Opera and Best Author-Narrator Team!! (Video Trailer included + FREE audiobook),"Hi Guys,

Hoping this falls within the rules for Saturday posts.  Please let me know if not.

***Paradigm 2045: Trinity's Children*** is my second series and first foray into Sci-fi.  The audiobooks are published by Podium Audio and print/kindle by Spartamac Publishing.  It's a near-future space opera and I'll include the description as part of this post along with my favorite review which turns out came from a fellow Redditor.

A couple weeks ago I heard from [Audiobookreviewers.com](https://Audiobookreviewers.com) that they had selected this new series for both their **Best Sci-fi and Best Author+Narrator Team (w/ Nick Podehl)** awards.  I'm not the best at self-promotion, but hopefully this post will help some folks determine if *Paradigm* is a series for them.

*Processing img xkrheogjgbh61...*

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start with the trailer because, quite frankly, the first time I saw it, I just thought it was super-cool.

*Processing video 7m020au6dbh61...*

Now, below I've copied my favorite review from Audible.  Apologies for it's length, but I didn't think it appropriate to selectively edit.

&gt;**Finally the Brown-Girl Super Hero we always wanted**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok, so maybe this story isn't really about super heroes, but they kinda ARE exactly that since they are all super smart and unimaginable talented. I picked up this book because I love Nick Podehl's narration and was BLOWN AWAY by the characters. Robert Ross is now a new favorite of mine and I quickly got my family hooked as well. My short review would say that this story is totally credit worthy and I can't wait until book 2 is released. It has all the best elements of a great story. Amazing characters, a believable plot with just the right mix of sci-fi and realism so that this feels like a very real near future world with a plausible problem, witty banter between characters, and a enough nerd nostalgia thrown in to be fun all come together to make a story that is a real treat. Spend the credit and listen. You won't be disappointed.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, my longer and more fangirlish review would say a lot more. I would start with the fact that the main character, Charlotte Omandi, is an African woman from Kenya who is tasked with saving the world by gathering a collection of similarly special people who are from all over the world. She is genetically enhanced to the point that her intelligence is basically a super power and she has to find a away to save everyone. The character is well written and from the first time we meet her we are pulled in and engaged to the point that we are fully invested in what feels like a real, fully fleshed out persons life and feelings as they navigate a dire situation. She is not a token brown girl character who really is just there to get the random white guy to save the day or to warm his bed. No, She really is the heart of the book and at every step she drives the story and supports the development of the other characters to the point that you realize that she is the heart of this and any subsequent books success.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Why is this important? Because as an avid sci-fi, fantasy, litrpg, DnD, all things nerd black woman and mother of 3, I enjoy not having to mentally change one of the characters race in my head so that, even if it's only in my head and not actually in the story, I can sometimes feel like I could be part of the story as well. So many authors forget to include strong, well written, minorities into their stories and they fail to understand the impact that a character like Charlotte can have on a reader. Not only is the female protagonist a underexplored path in sci-fi, but an educated, intelligent, engaging, strong, beautiful and not sex-driven MC is something I had to share with as many people as possible. And to have all this in an AWESOME story?! How could I not let everyone know. After reading this book I immediately gave it to my teen daughters, my brother, and my father to read. They all devoured the book within a day or two and asked when the next book will come out. It's that good.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;The crew that is assembled is from all over the world and Nick Podehl did a great job of distinguishing the characters and voicing the diverse and hilariously entertaining interactions between the characters. I loved every single character in this book and they felt like they were real people walking around in my imagination as I read this adventure. I can't say enough about how much I loved this book. Just read it. You will not be sorry, you may be angry that book 2 isn't out yet, but you will still be better off than the suckers who passed this one up.

So, if any of this sounds interesting to you, please feel free to check it out on [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/Trinitys-Children-Audiobook/1774244144).  I'm biased toward the audiobook because I think Nick Podehl does such a great job, but also know there are many who prefer [Print](https://www.amazon.com/Paradigm-2045-Trinitys-Robert-Ross/dp/B089LYH3L8) or [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0893N4HHD).

The second book in the series, *Paradigm 2045: Humanity's Promise* in in alpha test now with Podium planning to release it on August 31 of this year.  I usually attend Atlanta's DragonCon as one of their authors so try to always have a new book ready for that convention!!

I'm also in need of some potential FTL drives that can be used, and that can at least appear semi-real. I've had the idea of a slower, ship-mounted drive being used alongside something like a gate/launcher/etc that is used as the common interstellar highway.

Any and all thoughts and advice for making a sci-fi world would also be much appreciated. Thanks!"

*Processing img euhp1jiqh0h61...*

Hello everyone!

With the advent of new technologies, it became possible to improve old videos and images, so I decided to improve my favorite series ""Firefly"" myself. The original picture has a lot of noise, moreover, it is available only as a FHD. So I decided to fix it, but work on the project takes a very long time, so I decided to ask the community for help. An example of the result can be found on the links. The first episode is already ready and if there is a request for a continuation, then I will prepare the rest of the episodes. Perhaps, in the future, I will restore other videos as well.

**Content will be available on Patreon**: [patreon.com](https://www.patreon.com/CustomRemastered)

1138,scifi,Space Sweepers Question/Confusion *Spoilers!*,"I was going to post this into r/movies/ but I figured that  I'd be more likely to get a satisfactory answer here due to the in-depth, nerd-ish nature of the question. 
 
For those of you who HAVE NOT seen Space Sweepers,    my question contains major spoilers for the film, I recommend you watch it!  (Currently on Netflix) 
 
It's actually a pretty good sci-fi piece as far as I'm concerned, it gave me serious Cowboy Bebop vibes and a healthy dose of world-building as well.  The world and its rules are actually what I want to discuss here, I have a question about Tae-Ho's daughter Su-Ni.  If you forgot character names or the ending, there is an explanation page at screen rant:
https://screenrant.com/space-sweepers-tae-ho-suni-dead-nanobots-explained/
 
Sadly Su-Ni met an early end while her father was gambling and part of the giant poverty class space station they were on was blown away by a collision with debris of some sort.  It is my understanding that Su-Ni was completely human.

If she is human, how is it that the movie seems to portray Tae-Ho as expecting to retrieve his daughter alive.  It seems to me that he was open to the possibility that she would have been killed but was truly maintaining hope that he would be able to save her life somehow, after almost 3 years in Earth orbit after an explosive collision,exposure to the vacuum of space, and God knows what else.
 
The guide I linked above seems to indicate this as well but it, too, fails to explain anything or even address the aparrent plot hole. 
 
Did I miss something obvious or can someone help out with this one? Thanks, r/scifi, that is all!"

1.) one of the works of Scott Westerfeld (Peeps, Uglies, Leviathan) to be developed into an anime, 

2.) the Rifters Trilogy from Peter Watts (Starfish, Behemoth, and Maelstrom), or 

3.) the Gaea Trilogy by John Varley (Titan, Wizard, Demon).

&amp;#x200B;

They're each pretty awesome for different reasons, Westerfeld for his imaginative premises and pulpy approachability in his narrative, Watts for his intense psychological thrills and twisted depictions of the extremes of humanity, and Varley for his bonkers hippie vision of sexy space centaurs and shakesperean sentient AI drama."

I’m starting the Traveler rpg and want to play it similar to the Expanse/Star Trek. In the realm of possibility even if improbable I’m trying to think of a way for starships to travel across great distances to new star systems. My philosophy with speculative tech is that if there are at least factual elements experts consider would be a step into making that tech possible, you could create a hard-ish sci-fi explanation for it existing.

One thing I was thinking of is the Alcubierre drive, which actually bends space around its “bubble”. For an energy source I was thinking of a nuclear fusion drive. The game would be set a few hundred years in the future since (sorry to say it) we won’t see that in OUR lifetimes.

What do you suggest?

Side note: the next step is figuring out a limiting factor to prevent players from traversing the entire universe indefinitely in one moment. With a fusion drive I’ve put myself into a corner but maybe the longer the drive is used or the more energy consumed the more likely it is to become damaged, go off course, or bend space time in such a way that they would suck themselves into a mini blackhole?"

“And why did you bring me up here, Eight Clicks?” Quilx’tch demanded as he peeped his primary eye set over the edge of the sensory array. “Way up here?”  

“You have more experience observing humans than I do,” said the young Winged who had lured him up here. “I require your observations on an odd behavior pattern.”  

“Unless they are eating or not eating something, there is not much I can offer,” Quilx’tch said as he secured his grip on the surface with all eight of his appendages. “Please stop making the air currents worse!”  

“There,” Eight Clicks landed beside Quilx’tch and focused his binocular vision on a patch of ground far, far below them.  

Quilx’tch took in the scene and tried to note anything different. However, the patch of ground indicated by the Winged was indistinguishable from all the others to the nutritional anthropologist. “I see no humans… and therefore no human behavior to comment on!” Quilx’tch snapped out.  

“But you do see the fungal growth?” Eight Clicks asked eagerly.  

“What fungal growth?” Quilx’tch demanded, edging away from his mammalian companion.  

“Oh, right,” Eight Clicks muttered. “You Trisk have poor vision.”

“Our vision is perfectly adapted to our preferred habitat,” Quilx’tch snapped out. “Our pattern recognition at reasonable distances—”

“Yes, yes,” Eight Clicks rudely cut him off. “There is a fungal growth. That *Hexamartin* species is fruiting, and it formed a surface visible pattern. Here.” He projected an image of what Quilx’tch assumed was the ground below. A ring of the fungal fruiting bodies had indeed sprung up.

“Are the humans eating them?” Quilx’tch asked, curious now.  

“No, they are poisonous, I think,” Eight Clicks said. “But how can I, ah! Like this!” The Winged shifted the projection so that it overlaid the reality that Quilx’tch was seeing below him. The ring was indicated by a cluster of blue dots against the dusky orange of the ground cover. “Now just wait until the shift for lunch ends,” Eight Clicks instructed.  

Quilx’tch was rather interested now, so he waited as instructed. The tonal alarm sounded for the end of the lunch cycle, and the humans and Shatar spilled out of the communal cafeteria. This was an interesting position to observe mass behavior from, Quilx’tch decided.  

“Now keep an eye on the fungal growth,” Eight Clicks instructed him.

The mass of bipeds had reached the indicated spot on the ground, and Quilx’tch grew attentive as the pattern became obvious. The more brightly colored Shatar paced across the space without pause. The humans however, even with their lesser mobility, swerved to avoid passing through the circle formed by the fruiting bodies.  

“Fascinating,” Quilx’tch clicked softly.  

“The pattern holds too,” Eight Clicks said eagerly. “I have recorded this behavior in over twenty locations.”

“Is it conscious?” Quilx’tch asked.  

“Sometimes, sometimes not,” Eight Clicks said. “When it is conscious, I have noted them indicating body language that the Shatar’s lack of avoidance behavior causes the humans distress. However, the majority of the times it appears to be an instinctive reaction.”

“They do eat some fungal fruiting bodies,” Quilx’tch observed. “Perhaps it is simply an ingrained nutrient maximization behavior to avoid damaging fungal bodies that provided sustenance?”

“That is a sound theory,” Eight Clicks admitted.  

“However?” Quilx’tch prompted even as he watched the flow of humans.  

“When I brought my observations to Human Friend O’Beirne, he did not wish to answer,” Eight Clicks said.  

“You must have misunderstood him,” Quilx’tch protested. “Friend O’Beirne has almost no social inhibitions. Why… he spent the better part of a day discussing reproduction with me.”

“I am aware,” Eight Clicks said, flaring his wings in agitation. “That conversation was recorded. But I assure you. He has inhibitions about this. I was able to ascertain that it involved a human superstition.”  

“A superstition?” Quilx’tch asked eagerly.  

There was a vast blank of knowledge on current human superstitions. While that was well outside of his focus, it was still a fascinating topic.  

“The only specifics he offered was the term ‘ferry circles,’” Eight Clicks continued. “And he seemed terribly embarrassed by the observation. He displayed that odd behavior where he answers the question at inaudible volumes and in a direction away from you.”

“Ah,” Quilx’tch muttered. “We must proceed carefully.”  

“Indeed,” Eight Clicks agreed. “Why won’t humans walk through a ferry circle?”

1248,scifi,Riordan Retrospective: The Red Pyramid,"So, recently on my blog I completed my retrospective of the works of Rick Riordan.  It’s less of a formal review and more of a casual look back.  So, I thought I’d share my look back at book one of The Kane Chronicles, [The Red Pyramid ](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Pyramid-Kane-Chronicles-Book/dp/1423113381/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=) 

Carter and Sadie Kane are brother and sister, but have hardly ever seen each other.  Carter travels with their dad around the world on archaeological digs, while Sadie lives in London with their maternal grandparents.  Carter and Mr. Kane are visiting Sadie for Christmas vacation, and the trio go on a trip to the British Museum...and Mr. Kane is imprisoned in a sarcophagus of golden light, after blowing up the Rosetta Stone.  

Before long, the siblings discover a number of shocking revelations: the Egyptian gods are both real and active in the modern world, their parents are members of an ancient society of Egyptian magicians called The House of Life, and their dad is being held hostage by the god Set.  Oh, and they've only got five days to make sure Set doesn't take over the world.  Carter and Sadie are in for a whirlwind adventure of gods, monsters and magic.  

I've been a fan of Egyptian Mythology for a long time.  In fact, I was a fan of Egyptian Mythology even before I got into Classical Mythology.  So, you can imagine that I was really excited back when The Kane Chronicles was first announced.  Admittedly, I was a bit disappointed that Riordan mostly shied away from the animal-headedness of many of the Egyptian gods; that was one of the things always made them so cool to me.  Still, I'm overall reasonably happy with how he portrayed the gods.

Well, if I'm being honest, it's a bit more complicated than that.  Let me state up front, I don't thing Riordan necessarily did a bad job with the gods.  As per usual, his knowledge of the myths is second to none.  It's just...well, I've written stories of my own that involve Egyptian gods, so they're kind of like old friends to me.  As such, sometimes it feels weird how Riordan interprets the gods in the modern world.  For example, Thoth is an absent-minded professor.  Nothing bad there in and of itself, just not how I would have written him.  Thought, admittedly, Riordan's Thoth has started to grow on me over the years.  Like I said, nothing inherently bad, just my own bit of weirdness and biases. 

A common criticism the series gets is that the characters are a bit too similar to Percy Jackson characters.  I suppose that's true to an extent.  Carter and Annabeth do have somewhat similarly brainy personalities, but they have enough differences to keep things interesting.  People always say that Sadie is similar to Percy, but I just don't see it.  She just comes across as a bit too bitchy to really be remotely similar to Percy.  Speaking of Sadie, at times it felt like Riordan was trying to make her edgy and rebellious, but had to keep things family friendly, and couldn't go as far as he wanted to. 

I suppose that's why she says ""God!"" so much.  And yeah, God singular.  One of the things I always liked about Percy Jackson was how Riordan adapted to swearing and exclamation to the polytheistic setting, so I was rather disappointed that The Kane Chronicles didn't follow suit, at least for the first two books.  Sadie does also say bloody a lot, but that might have been Riordan slipping up.  For those who don't get it, in British English, using bloody as an exclamation is considered minor swearing, akin to saying shit or damn.  Then again, we all remember that scene in The Titan's Curse at the dam snack bar, so who knows. 

I do thing that The Kane Chronicles differs from Percy Jackson in scope and feel.  Percy Jackson takes place almost exclusively in America, baring a few bits in the Bermuda Triangle.  The Kane Chronicles, by contrast, has much more of a globe trekking feel to it.  Granted, much of The Red Pyramid still primarily takes place in America, but we also get scenes set in Britain, France and Egypt.  It does help that, thanks to magic, the characters can teleport across the world at a moment's notice.  Another thing is that you get just as much Ancient Egyptian history as mythology.  Rather than being children of the gods, Carter and Sadie, as well as pretty much everyone else in the House of Life, are descended from the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt.  Specifically, they're descended from Narmer on their dad's side, and Ramses the Great on their mom's side.  Fun fact, the House of Life was an actual institution that existed during Ancient Egypt. 

The Egyptian gods have a different feel to them than the Greek gods of Percy Jackson.  They feel, at times, a bit more raw and primeval.  So, let's talk about the concept of hosting.  It took my a while to wrap my head around how works, but I think I've finally figured out an explanation.  An Egyptian god manifesting in the human world without being hosted by something would be like a human stepping onto the Moon without a spacesuit.  The gods need things to help anchor them to the mortal world.  It doesn't have to be humans, it can be anything from a building to a car.  In the latter case, it doubles as a rather literal example of deus ex machina.  They also tend to prefer humans who have Blood of the Pharaohs.   

Now let's get a bit more serious and talk about race, specifically, Carter and Sadie's race.  Their father is black American and their mother is white British.  Carter is looks more black, while Sadie looks more white, to the point that people often don't realize that they're siblings.  This isn't as crazy as it sounds; there's actually quite a few cases of mixed race siblings where each sibling tends to favor one parent's race over the other.  This actually doesn't come up all that much, and never gets preachy.  

This ties into another point: what race were the Ancient Egyptians?  Egypt sits at the crossroads of three continents, so you do get a good mix of peoples.  Overall, though, not all that different from the modern-day Egyptians; meaning similar to the Arabs and other Middle Eastern peoples.  Genetic analysis of mummies has pretty much confirmed this theory.  In fairness, Egypt has several black dynasties during the reign of the Nubians, and we have the very Egyptian Zia Rashid as Carter's eventual love interest as prominent character to provide some balance on the racial front.  Unlike a certain other series, it never dips into ""We Wuz Kangz"" territory, but I'm getting a head of myself.  We'll get to Magnus Chase in our due time.

When I first read this series, I was sure that Iskander, the Chief Lecter of the House of Life, was going to turn out to be Alexander the Great.  Iskander is the Arabic form of the name Alexander, and it is mentioned that he's been around since the Ptolemaic Dynasty.  Sadly, it turns out that I was wrong, and all of the above were red herrings.  Then again, Alexander the Great claimed to be a son of Zeus, so that would have opened a whole new can of worms.  Also, the Chief Lecter is the second in command, and the one who runs the House of Life when the pharaoh isn't around. 

In other events, I'm quite happy with how Set was portrayed.  It's set-up (hahaha, I said set!) to make it look like yet another poorly researched story where Set is portrayed as the Ancient Egyptian Satan, which isn't even close to being true.  Then the story subverts it all by revealing that Set is being manipulated by the true villain of the series: Apophis.  Set has always had a bit of a bad reputation even since ancient times.  You can blame it on the time the Hyksos people invaded Egypt.  Set was their favorite god, so the Egyptians began to associate Set with foreign invaders.  Over time, he got increasingly conflated with Apophis; which is ironic, because Set helped Ra battle Apophis every night.  

I liked how the series was able to reconcile mythology and science.  As Bast explains it, two things can be true in different ways.  Chairs exist, but so does the idea of chairs.  The sun can exist as a physical star, but Ra and his solar barge can exist as the embodiment of humanity's hopes and dreams about the sun.  Also, like The Demigod Files before it, The Red Pyramid confirms that Rick Riordan exists as a character in the Riordanverse.  The Kane Chronicles are explained to be based on a series of audio recording given to Riordan from the Kane siblings.  It also turns out that not every famous person was a demigod.  Some, like Elvis, were members of the House of Life.   

On the flip side, I thought that Riordan could have handled the religious implications better.  For example, Uncle Amos is very adamant that the House of Life doesn't worship the gods...except that what he describes is pretty much worship in all but name.  This is particularly odd, as there's a scene in Battle of the Labyrinth where Percy prays to Apollo and Artemis for good luck, and he's prayed to Poseidon plenty of times.  Even more bafflingly, it's confirmed that Moses existed in the Riordanverse, and was apparently the only magician who ever bet the House of Life in a magic contest.  

Now, there's a couple reasons for why this might be.  One, Riordan himself is a Christian of some stripe; my guess is Episcopalian based on how he used to work for an Episcopalian summer camp.  On the other hand, he did eventually more comfortable incorporating aspects of pagan religion into his books as time went on, so maybe that wasn't it.  More likely, he was fearing backlash from the Religious Right, and other such groups.  Remember, The Red Pyramid was published back when the whole ""Harry Potter Leads Kids to Satanism"" hubbub was still fresh in everyone's memory.  As such, Riordan might have wanted to avoid similar controversy. 

Despite The Kane Chronicles taking place in the same universe as Percy Jackson, we don't really get much in the way of crossovers.  The closest is when Uncle Amos looks to the Empire State Building and remarks that Manhattan has other gods, and other problems.  Well, we don't get much crossover in the main series.  Hopefully, Audible.com will get its act together and we'll be able to discuss Demigods and Magicians at some point.  

Speaking of Audible.com, let's take a moment to talk about the audiobook.  It features two narrators; Kevin R. Free narrates Carter's chapters, while Katherine Kellgren narrates Sadie's chapters.  This was my first encounter with Kevin R. Free, and he certainly does a good job.  So imagine my surprise when I encountered him again as the voice of Kevin from Welcome to Night Vale.  It was kind of surreal, since first and foremost, he'll always be Carter Kane to me.  

Now we have to get a little bit sad.  Earlier this year, Katherine Kellgren lost her long battle with cancer and passed away.  She narrated numerous audiobooks over the years, and was a much beloved narrator, but to me she'll always be Sadie Kane.  Was her narrator not always perfect, and sometimes a bit annoying?  Perhaps, but she always gave it her best shot, and whoever replaces her will have some awfully big shoes to fill.  

I'm not a big can of the [new cover](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1gnMsXyv6ho/Wq6or6U_RDI/AAAAAAAAA6M/VgP6Uc7o5SMTeGKK-TZt3IhirEEpZkONgCLcBGAs/s1600/Red%2BPyrmaid%2BNu%2BCover.jpg).  Aesthetically, it just feel like a big step backwards.  Even the new logo looks like a step backwards.  We see Carter and Sadie standing behind the Brooklyn Bridge, with a the Red Pyramid looming in the background.  Also, there's a statue of either Amun or Khnum, despit neither of them appearing in The Red Pyramid.  What else can I say?  The new cover sucks, let's move onto the  [older and better cover](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jz6baZOfLNc/Wq6oHKg2flI/AAAAAAAAA6E/o6W9f1xQ_6sNi39uh2o46frmZt3iwoAXACLcBGAs/s1600/9780545398268_mres.jpg)

We see Carter and Sadie standing in front of Brooklyn House, seat of the 21st Nome, while magical hieroglyphs float around them.  Nomes were administrative divisions used in Ancient Egypt, and are still used by the House of Life to divide their territory across the world.  There are 360 in total, with the First Nome, the House of Life's headquarters, being based in Egypt.

1292,scifi,The Expanse TV: how they wrote out that one character in S05 [spoiler heavy if you're not caught up],"I posted this in /r/theexpanse but it got shadow-removed, if it makes sense. I can still see it, but other users see it as [removed]. Hopefully I can get a discussion going here, because on /r/TheExpanse eveyone seem to be more than ok on how things went, which I find kinda incredible given the grinding difference between the overall quality of the show and this one plot point.

So, I just finished S05 and I hated how they managed Alex's exit. Not the way he went in the show per se, but how it was told in the narrative context.

Honestly, there was no setup, there was no payoff, and there was no WEIGHT to it showed on screen. I loved the show up to that point, but this scene was so narratively OFF that the moment the credits rolled I googled to check if it was the same in the books, and lo and behold, I discover it was scrapped together with re-shoots (had no idea of the whole drama behind it). I immediately had a dejavu of ""Poochie died on the way back to his home planet"".

Ways to get a better exit, while keeping the core plot point:

1) add a set-up. Alex, while still on mars, discovers that all his high-g spinning has compromised his health somehow. a doctor tells him the obligatory ""if you continue like this you're risking your life"". this way, when it's time to save Naomi, Alex can willingly choose to save his firend's life in exchange of his own. a hero's death and a satisfactory payoff for the early setup.

2) add CLOSURE and emotional weight to his death. all we got was one shot of him dying, and Holden sayng ""they'll give him a state funeral"". 1 minute later they're literally hanging around on luna drinking and laughing like they don't have one care in the world. We also get a funny scene between Holden, Amos and Clarissa, as if it's not grinding in tone with the emotions I (and the characters) should be feeling. This is not how you add weight to a character's death. Let me see the funeral. Let me see his wife and kid bawling accepting the martian flag. Let me see how other characters react to this (like for example Bobbie, that didn't react at all in the actual show despite being pretty close to him). Let me hear an eulogy by some of his Roci family, tying together in a coherent way the meories I build with this character for 5 seasons. You know, CLOSURE.

Can you imagine if after 10 years of marvel movies, the goodbye to that one beloved character in end game was like the one they gave to Alex?

I don't claim to be a better writer than the guys running the show, and given the super high quality they gave us so far, I suspect that the reason this plot point was so superficially written was not for lack of inspiration, but because somehow they (or possibly the PR/network execs) didn't want Alex's death to be heroic or emotionally involving at all. As if ruining a main character would make ""justice"" of the fact that the actor who played him turned out to be a questionable person. My impression is that they took revenge on Alex for something Cas Anvar did, stripping him (Alex) of a decent exit and ruining what could have been, if nothing else, an acceptable plot twist and touching moment."

A friend told me that there is a post-apocalyptic, road trip, kind of space opera movie that I should check out; perhaps the community can help me out in finding a copy on media or a place to stream it from?

From what my friend told me the basic plot is about a group of good people protecting a valuable and scarce liquid resource from the bad folks.  Apparently the good folks are all a bit hairy (hairy like Wookies and Ewoks and so forth) and the bad folks are all dressed in white armor and are agents of some sort of Galactic Federation and have blasters and such and cannot aim very well.

I recognize that what I described above sounds kind of deranged, but as I am quarantining myself after being exposed to someone who was diagnosed with COVID-19 I am running out of options to entertain myself and the above-described film seems to be to be at least a wee bit interesting.

She told me the title of this film is ""Star Wars episode XVII: Mad Max -- Furry Road"".

Thanks in advance for your assistance in my quest."

Star Trek Discovery ended up getting almost 10 million viewers when it premiered on CBS but some fans complained about the new direction Star Trek was going in.

I found Nat Geo's Mars to be boring.

I think it was about halfway through that It turned into a bit of a slog. But because the beginning was so full of intrigue, promise, mostly great writing and beautiful scenes, I wanted to see it through. I don't think it was worth it though, in the end. For me, it didn't recover that initial magic, or deliver on the set-up, though it seemed to come close at times. I actually liked the ending, where the two Bs turn into the planetary tree, but it still didn't feel like it all fit together.

I enjoyed the meta themes, and kept finding parts that made it feel ok to keep going. I hated the brutal torturer guy that just turned up at a certain point. I don't know why he was there. I was annoyed by the backward travelling military commander, and didn't really enjoy the religious element at all. I feel like she was trying to pull off something pretty brave by switching a lot of the focus away from the main character of the early sections, but it didn't quite come together for me. 

I also had the feeling that the translator wasn't perhaps the best. If you've read it - in English or Japanese - does this chime with your experience, or have I missed something that might help me re-evaluate?"

1711,scifi,Riordan Retrospective: The Serpent’s Shadow,"Welcome once again to the Riordan Retrospective.  For those of you just joining the fun, this is my look back at the works of Rick Riordan.  This is less of a formal review, and more of a look back, along with my thoughts and observations.  Last time we’re taking a look back at book three of The Kane Chronicles, The Serpent’s Shadow. [The Serpent’s Shadow ](https://www.amazon.com/Serpents-Shadow-Kane-Chronicles-Book/dp/1423142020/ref=nodl_)

This is the moment everything has been building up to.  The final showdown with Apophis is at hand, and the House of Life is about to make its last stand against the forces of chaos.  There isn't really much more I can add, so let's jump directly to my thoughts.  Also, as usual, there's going to be plenty of spoilers.  Turn back now if you want to avoid that sort of thing. 

Before we get any further, I'd like to address something I should have brought up in previous retrospectives: where Mr. and Mrs. Kane married?  We know that after Mrs. Kane died her parents fought Mr. Kane for custody of Carter and Sadie.  The only way that would be even remotely possible is if Julius and Ruby hadn't been married; if you don't get married, and your spouse dies, then their parents can fight you for custody of your kids.  The only other scenario is if the parent is severely negligent and/or abusive, and that's certainly not the case here.

It only gets more complicated when you consider that Ruby's parents are British, and now your dragging international law into it.  And they couldn't expect to just say ""Julius is unfit to be a parent because his lifestyle as a magician who fights gods and monsters puts these children at risk"" without the judge laughing them out of court.  Also, why did they only get Sadie, and Mr. Kane only got Carter?  Wouldn't the judge want to keep the siblings together? 

The whole affair always just never made sense to me.  Speaking of familial relations, let's talk about Setne.  He is bound to Carter and Sadie's service as punishment for his crimes against the gods.  This, along with the fact that he later betrays them, is rather odd.  Setne was an actual historical figure, specifically he was the son of Ramses the Great.  He was beloved by the people of Ancient Egypt, a faithful servant of the gods and considered a hero. Granted, you could argue that he did so in a chaotic way, which the gods wouldn't approve of, but it is still rather odd for him to be portrayed as a villain. 

As I've previously mentioned, I kind of figured that Sadie's love triangle would be resolved by Walt becoming the host of Anubis.  Walt will be the Eye of Anubis, and Anubis will be a living god like the pharaohs of old.  Apparently, the more time they spend like that the more their personalities will merge together.  I guess it's kind of like the end of the second Rosario+Vampire manga where Inner Moka and Outer Moka combine to form a composite Moka.  Alternatively, it's kind of like how Mr. Kane and Osiris are pretty much one and the same.  Does that mean Carter and Sadie are, technically, children of Osiris?   

On that topic, back in the first book Rick tried to dance around the fact that Isis and Osiris were brother and sister, but also husband and wife.  It was explained as one time a brother and sister hosted them, and then a husband and wife hosted them.  Yeah, that didn't happen in the original myths, but I understand why he did that.  Egyptian Mythology is...kind of full of incest, which isn't a very family-friendly topic, so yeah.  

We finally get an answer to a question I'd been wondering for a while: what happens to atheists when they die in the Riordanverse?  Apparently, they don't see anything, at least if they default to the Egyptian afterlife.  We are told this, and yet it's contradicted by the text itself.  We see a man being judged who didn't believe in any gods, but had a love of Ancient Egypt, and he can see everything perfectly fine.  That was my personal take on the matter; if you don't have any strong convictions you ought to default to whatever the dominant pantheon is wherever you happen to be.  

So, moving to lighter subjects, during Sadie and friends' dance we get a surprise cameo by Drew Tanaka and Lacy from The Heroes of Olympus.  The Kane Chronicles does take places in the same universe as Percy Jackson/The Heroes of Olympus, but I gotta admit, I wasn't expecting characters from the other series to appear.  Then, of course, there were the official crossovers, but that's a topic for another time.  As previously mentioned, I liked Set's reasoning for fighting with the other gods.  He may be the god of chaos, but he views himself as someone who shakes things up and breaks old patterns.  Apophis, by contrast, just wants to destroy everything.

As with the previous installment, the series takes a more international approach than Percy Jackson does.  Besides some early scenes in Dallas and Brooklyn, almost all of the scenes on Earth take place in Egypt.  By sear coincidence, this part of the series came out not too long after the Arab Spring happened.  I wonder if, in the Riordanverse, Apophis had a hand in all of that. Good thing the series came out when it did; any later and it would have been pretty difficult to have scenes set in Egypt.  Hmm, I wonder if Apophis also had a hand in creating the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.  Did he convince them to pick that name in order to defame the goddess Isis?  

Also, it's mentioned that Dallas Museum of Art was hosting a King Tut exhibit.  A few years before this book came out, it really did.  In fact, my family took a trip to Dallas to see it.  King Tut, however, was not actually at the exhibit, which was mildly disappointing.  Still, it was great to see all of the Egyptian artifacts, many of which I'd only seen in books before that.  Kind of cool to think my counterpart in the Riordanverse might have bumped into Carter and Sadie.  Well, Apophis did kill all of the magicians at the Dallas nome, meaning I might have wound up as collateral damage so...yeah.  

While we're speculating, let's talk about Thoth.  We know that he was the only god the House of Life didn't banish in ancient times.  It is said that they did this because he's the god of magic, and thus their patron and founder.  What if there's more to it than just that?  Without the other gods around he'd get all of the prayers and offerings, and potentially more power, so what if he was behind the banishment of all the other gods?  The Riordanverse version of Thoth might act silly and scatterbrained, but maybe, just maybe, he just might be the biggest chess master in the entire Riordanverse. 

I gotta admit, when the series started off I really wasn't sure about Sadie, but she grew on me.  I honestly feel like I witnessed her grow as a character.  At the start of the series she's very rude and brash, but does so as a coping mechanism to hide her insecurities.  By series end she's calmed down and matured a bit.  She accept that her life won't ever be normal, but that's okay, because she's a magician of the House of Life.  I really like how she embraced the magical and otherworldly part of her life, rather than pining after a ""normal"" teenage life.  She also finally got around to using polytheistic swearing.  

As was prophesied at the start of the series, Carter becomes the first pharaoh in over 2000 years, but leaves most of the day to day affairs to Uncle Amos.  Carter has never loved the spotlight, in large part because of his upbringing.  He never got to do typical kid things because he was always traveling with his dad.  Unlike many other Riordanverse characters, he didn't really ever have a taste of ""normal"" life.  I like to think that eventually he'll learn to accept his life as it is like Sadie did.  

So we all knew Apophis was going to be defeated, but it was a fun ride to get there.  Unfortunately, since order cannot exist without chaos, the gods will be withdrawing from the world as well.  That is rather sad, especially given how nice, for the most part, they tend to be.  Still, at least Carter and Sadie can visit them in the Duat.  And hey, Anubis gets to say because Walt is hosting him as his eye.  

As I've previously mentioned, one of the drawbacks to The Kane Chronicles only being three-books-long is that the minor characters don't get as much time to shine.  For example, in this book we meet a young Russian magician named Leonid who learn the Path of Shu, god of the wind, against the wishes of his nome.  He felt a bit underutilized.  On a more positive note, Felix finally found his magic: ice magic!  That combined with his love of penguins, will probably make him the only magician who actually wants to be assigned to the Antarctica nome.  The Egyptian Pantheon doesn't have a snow deity, so I don't know which Path of the Gods he'll be taking.

The book ends with Sadie mentioning that mysterious magical activity has been discovered on Long Island, and that an investigation will be commencing soon.  Obviously, this is setting things up for the crossover short stories collection Demigods &amp; Magicians. 

Speaking of audiobooks, for one final time, I'm going to plug the audiobook version of The Serpent's Shadow. [The Serpent’s Shadow ](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Serpents-Shadow-The-Kane-Chronicles-Book-3-Audiobook/B007T8F49I?qid=1536549050&amp;sr=sr_1_1&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&amp;pf_rd_p=e81b7c27-6880-467a-b5a7-13cef5d729fe&amp;pf_rd_r=NEYM9C1N179RWRC1TSN8&amp;)

Well, I think it's time I gave my overall thoughts on The Kane Chronicles.  Like I said in the Red Pyramid retrospective, not a perfect series, and I admit some of my objections are unique to me, but overall not a bad series.  It doesn't quite have the charm of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, but it is still well worth reading.  Who knows, you just might learn something new about Egyptian Mythology and/or Ancient Egyptian History.  

For one final times, let's analyze the old cover[the old cover](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ewAFixwNSyg/W5XeliCuY5I/AAAAAAAABDM/YG4VRRl7IgwGnOXksZuQ2oFzuyOrDwZDgCLcBGAs/s1600/9780545594318_mres.jpg).  We see Carter and Sadie deep within the Duat.  They're admits the primordial sea of chaos and are making their way to the very first land, where Ma'at, given form by the obelisk, shines bright.  Apophis looms ominously in the clouds. 

The new cover[The new cover](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rd8F3Dca6i8/W5XfMFCOvyI/AAAAAAAABDU/nme_dOa5QIYjVT1nRZ1U5XM5HIfuoPFNQCLcBGAs/s1600/Kane-SERPENT-SHADOW-cover-final.72-1.jpg) is...actually, it's not half bad.  We see Carter and Sadie standing in front of the Pyramids of Giza as Apophis rises out of the sands.  Easily the best of the new covers, even if it doesn't quite have the charm of the original.

Most of Godsquatter takes place in present(ish) day. But in proper Space Odyssey fashion, it begins somewhat further back:

# Prologue: The Bellwether

*30,000 BCE, give or take*

It had been the stone age for a good long while now, and Ook was thinking it might be actually more than a fad. And he was cool with that. He didn't much like hanging around in trees anyhow, and wasn't all that good at climbing or picking fleas off himself. But those days were finally behind him; ever since that fateful day when one inspired monkey decided to check out what the ground had to offer—and made a discovery that changed everything. Suddenly, twigs and branches were passé. Walking was the way of the future. And rocks were all the rage.

Rocks. Harder than bone, stronger than steel (which hadn't been invented yet), and useful to boot. At first Ook had been content to sit back and let the early adopters figure it all out. He watched as trendsetters showed off their skills using rocks to crack shells, break other rocks, and establish dominance by beating each other senseless. And that's when Ook realized it wasn't actually rocks that were so great, it was the attention they got you. Ook tried using a few of his own rocks to pummel other monkeys and move up the social food-chain, but his results were mixed. And often painful. So instead, he decided a smarter approach would be to find the next fancy new way of using rocks. Something really cool that would catch on with the other ground monkeys and finally get him noticed. But no sooner did he have the thought than someone had already beat him to it.

Like most of his coworkers, Ook spent his days in the field enjoying the sun, avoiding tigers, and digging up and smashing things with rocks. It never got old. It could be surprisingly useful. It was trending. And it was on one of these typical rock-smashing days that Ook's old tree-mate, Gronk, showed up and announced the greatest discovery in history; something even more exciting than rocks.

At first no one believed Gronk's desperate efforts to explain himself. But making it all sound like anything but mumbo jumbo nonsense was beyond the monkeys' primitive dialect. Eventually Gronk decided he simply needed to show them. He picked up two rocks, smashed them together, and introduced everyone to fire.

Fire was an instant sensation. Flashy yet understated, soon every modern ground monkey had their own. For some it was family campfires. For others it was communal blazes. And for many it was portable torches (which, incidentally, made twigs and branches retro and cool again). Even Ook hopped the fire bandwagon, albeit grudgingly, as he obsessively built and maintained his own fire lest any neighbor monkeys think him a luddite or technophobe.

And so, for a time, fire dominated the news cycle at every social gathering. Flammable, sharable and fun; everyone had fire, loved fire and wanted more fire. But, deep down, everyone also knew that fire was just a novelty with no real use. Before long, the ground monkeys grew bored with fire and started looking for their next fixation. They found it in caves.

Spacious, protective and trendy, caves—really just big rocks with big holes in them—were amazingly simple, yet highly useful. Ook had been too late to discover caves as well. That good fortune had fallen on some other monkey, which left Ook longing for his own viral breakthrough so he too could bask in waves of adulation from several, if not dozens, of adoring ground monkey followers.

Ook was discouraged, but not completely. Still hoping to find his chance to become an influencer, he continued his days of digging through the dirt, pulling up rocks, and wishing just one of them would inspire an idea so he could finally go mainstream. Some of what he found were sharp fire-rocks. Most were smashy rock-rocks. But none were particularly unique rocks. And none seemed likely to make him famous.

The night before Ook's big break was, in itself, quite extraordinary. Rain was nothing new. Nor was lightning. But rarely had there been so much of both. And never so colorful. Brilliant yellows, purples and greens beamed across the sky, dazzled in place, and then exploded against the neighboring landscape with thunderous aplomb. Ook would have likened it to an acid trip or a disastrously reckless firework display, but he lacked context for such things. So instead he contented himself with cowering beneath a large rock and declaring the night to be ""loud,"" ""bright"" and ""scary as hell.”

\* \* \*

Aside from the brushfires, craters, and overwhelming scent of metallicized ozone, the following morning was a lot like any other. Ook emerged from hiding, dusted himself off, and resumed his duties digging up rocks from the freshly scorched earth. But this time, as he pulled his first rock, he noticed something odd. Oblong and lumpy, it was mostly pretty ordinary, except for the strange spots and tawny orange color. Ook held the rock and sniffed it. Firm, he noticed. Firm, but not hard. He licked some dirt from the rock and spit at the earthy blandness. Not food, he decided. 

Seeing no value in a not-hard, not-edible rock, Ook tossed it aside, where it rolled a few feet before stopping at a nearby fire. Ook returned to work, but spent the next hour finding nothing but frustration as he dug up a mounting collection of similarly useless not-rocks. Large ones, small ones, and ranging from orange to brown to even a few purples; they were each of them too soft for smashing, too squishy for fire making, and exactly the wrong shape to inspire Ook to invent the brick, the wheel, or juggling. 

Ook was tired, and very near to giving up on rocks completely to instead run off and invent calligraphy or something, but was then distracted by an enticing smell wafting from behind. Ook sniffed, turned around, and looked at his discarded, fire-baked not-rock. He walked over to pick it up and feel its warmth. He bit into the soft, crispy flesh. And he smiled.

Gronk may have discovered fire, he thought, but it was Ook who discovered what fire was meant for. And it was also Ook who'd just thought up a killer recipe for sour cream.

Later in the book they had emerged and formed a society on the surface and they fought an enemy consisting of cyclists who, during an atomic blast, had been fused to the handlebars and were not savage man-bike hybrids.

A masterpiece.","I see why many say it lost its way midway through but by that point I had bought into the characters including the superbly played Mother, and the religious ideology. All set against the backdrop of a desolate planet paying homage to mans last stand. It is such a superb premise. 

The actress who plays mother is astonishingly good. She deserves to win major accolades and I hope she does. I’ve never seen an Android character depicted so well before. From her bodily movements to facial expressions etc. Her athleticism is plain to see. Small touches like when she would sit up from a lying down position, without using her hands and arms for support, only stomach muscles. It was so fascinating watching her. She stole the show. 

There are of course many unexplained elements. And I’m hoping season two doesn’t go by the way of for example ‘Lost’ did, from back in the day. There the writers clearly couldn’t join all the story arc dots together. In order to stretch the seasons out for the network and advertisers, they strayed so far from any meaningful plot line, that the show ultimately failed in every way as a result. The same happened to The walking dead. 

The world created was so huge, mysterious and epic that I cannot wait for the next season. The production value is so incredibly high, of course a couple of episodes weren’t as strong as obviously the first few which were sublime, but I’m willing to let that go, what with the level of cinematic expertise and quality that went into this masterpiece."

I believe it played on the same week if not days before ABC's ""The Day After"". Both are products of the the fear of nuclear proliferation after Reagan was elected. ""The Day After"" was more a film style movie whereas this one was shot on video to give a real news feel which led to a very mild but distinct ""War Of The Worlds "" reaction nationwide even with disclaimers and commercials. 

On a personal note, they may been influenced by the previous summer's ('82) anti-nuclear rally which I attended in Central Park in NYC in June. I think it's a pretty dramatic demonstration.

1980,scifi,The Uncanny Valley of hard sci-fi (Suspension of Disbelief),"When watching films like Star Wars, Avengers, Star Trek, people seldom struggle with suspension-of-disbelief.  We just enjoy the ride.  

And then there's films like ""The Martian"", ""Gattaca"", ""Gravity"", and ""2001"" which contain a few minor scientific inaccuracies, but not enough to disrupt the narrative.

But most films fall somewhere in between, and this is where I struggle. And I'm not talking about *bad* sci-fi.  I'm talking about highly regarded films/shows.

- The Expanse.

- Sunshine.

- Interstellar. 

- Ad Astra.


The two most obvious inaccuracies are ""inconsistent gravity"" and disregard for propellant. For example, I love Expanse. The show makes a strong effort to adhere to physics (better than any other TV series). But the Rocinante would need a propellant tank 10x the size of the ship to complete the maneuvers that it makes in a single episode.  (the Millennium Falcon makes all kinds of crazy maneuvers, and I never think about it)

These films all have devoted fans, and discussions about scientific accuracy (or lack thereof), often get heated. Fans never say ""Relax, it's just a show"", which is really the correct answer. 

I'd like to know if other people experience this Uncanny Valley of scientific plausibility.

And what sort of things trigger it?"

### Humans are Weird – Enough C4

“And Commander Grimes agreed with my analysis, sir,” the young human was explaining.  

Commandant Twirls idly wondered, not for the first time, why the human was forcing himself into that rigid death-like posture while giving his report. All the humans who came before him did it. He wondered if he was curious enough about it to look up the reason in the human behavioral archives. He realized the human had ceased talking, leaving only the soft pulsing of the great central fluid and gaseous pumps of the mammal to fill the room with ambient sound. Deciding that the human wished a response, the Commandant raised his primary gripping appendages in what he hoped mimicked the human’s placating body language. He did not want to frighten the young Ranger.  

“So to summarize,” Commandant Twirls began, “you observed the rapidly reproducing species that had infested the ship and determined through practical experimentation that the infestation could not be eliminated or controlled.”

The human bobbed his cranial mass once quickly to confirm the statement. His skin flushed with a rainbow of colors. The spectrum indicated sick horror and shame if the Commandant was any judge of human character. The great pumps began to work faster and then fell out of unison as the human used the gaseous pumps to maintain control over the fluid one. The Commandant would have liked to attempt to soothe the human, but he was afraid to condescend to the youngster, so he continued but added a reminder to his summary.  

“You are not being chastised for your choices, Ranger,” Commandant Twirls assured him. “The species was identified, and it was a non-sentient replicant threat. The Central University confirms the field assessment you performed. Now, you evacuated the lower section of your survey ship and detonated the entire ship’s supply of the human explosive designated C-4 in the affected section.”

“Plus the stuff we were carrying out to Gamma base,” the human added.  

Twirls noted with relief that the human was displaying less stress, and some colors of pleasure even played across the stripes on his face. Though the concept that remembering a giant, near fatal explosion was the cause of this pleasure was disturbing.

“Indeed. You detonated the supply and destroyed the central reproductive chamber of the infestation. This further exposed the interior of that section of the ship to open space.”

“Yes, sir,” the human replied.  

“Here is the one question the council has,” Twirls began gently. “And do recall that we are not going to ultimately override the decisions of our field agents in such a situation. You did preserve all the lives of your crew and protected the local inhabited sector. However, we do want to understand the logic of the next step.”

“I understand,” the human stated.

“For the record then,” Commandant Twirls said, “your own analysis shows that you believed the threat had been eliminated by the use of the C-4. Why then did you jettison the infected portions of the ship and take the next steps recorded in the log?”

“We didn’t think the C-4 was enough, sir,” the human replied. “I mean there was always a chance one of the sub-queens had laid an egg-cyst in a hard-to-reach place, and we decided that the risk of one of those hatching halfway home wasn’t worth the reward of having the added stability of the lower superstructure and supplies that were left after the detonation.”

“So you jettisoned that segment of the ship,” the Commandant concluded, running his trained reading appendages over the report he was lying on, “sent it on a collision course with an asteroid, then voided the contents of your backup power supply, causing a nuclear detonation when the supply collided with the asteroid and the jettisoned section.”

The human’s face blanched so deeply that the pulsing blood vessel network was visible under the stripes.  

“It was the only way to be sure,” he muttered.
